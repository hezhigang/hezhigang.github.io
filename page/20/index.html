<p>The answer to these questions can only be got by starting from the conception of phenomena which has hitherto been justified by experience, and which Newton assumed as a foundation, and by making in this conception the successive changes required by facts which it cannot explain. Researches starting from general notions, like the investigation we have just made, can only be useful in preventing this work from being hampered by too narrow views, and progress in knowledge of the interdependence of things from being checked by traditional prejudices.<br>This leads us into the domain of another science, of physic, into which the object of this work does not allow us to go to-day.</p>
<p>One now finds indeed approximately this number of real roots within these limits, and it is very probable that all roots are real. Certainly one would wish for a stricter proof here; I have meanwhile temporarily put aside the search for this after some fleeting futile attempts, as it appears unnecessary for the next objective of my investigation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural science is the attempt to comprehend nature by precise concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The word hypothesis has now a somewhat different significance from that given it by Newton. We are now accustomed to understand by hypothesis all thoughts connected with the phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Newton was far from the crude thought that explanation of phenomena could be attained by abstraction.</p>

<p>No mathematician is more associated with the midnineteenth-century transition <strong>from algorithmic to conceptual thought</strong> than Riemann. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princeton_Companion_to_Mathematics">The Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>)</p>
<p>It is clearly a preliminary note and might not have been written if L. Kronecker had not urged him to write up something about this work (letter toWeierstrass, Oct. 26 1859). It is clear that there are holes that need to be filled in, but also clear that he had a lot more material than what is in the note. What also seems clear: Riemann is not interested in an asymptotic formula, not in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">prime number theorem</a>, <strong>what he is after is an exact formula!</strong> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atle_Selberg">Atle Selberg</a> comments about Riemann’s paper <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Number_of_Primes_Less_Than_a_Given_Magnitude">On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude</a>)</p>
<p>黎曼的这篇1854年的论文，是非常重要的，也是几何里的一个基本文献，相当一个国家的宪法似的。爱因斯坦不知道这篇论文，花了七年的时间想方设法也要发展同样的观念，所以爱因斯坦浪费了许多时间。… <strong>不过很有意思的是我想 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor">Riemann-Christofell 曲率张量</a> 是一个很伟大的发现，黎曼就到法兰西科学院申请奖金。科学院的人看不懂，就没有给他。</strong>… 得不得到奖不是一个很重要的因素，黎曼就没有得到奖。他的 Riemann-Christofell 张量在法兰西的科学院申请奖没有得到。 (什么是几何学, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern">陈省身</a>)</p>
<p>Before Riemann introduced the notion of what is now called a ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface">Riemann surface</a>’, mathematicians had been at odds about how to treat these socalled ‘many-valued functions’, of which the logarithm is one of the simplest examples. … <strong>Riemann taught us we must think of things differently</strong>. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Reality">The Road to Reality</a>, chapter 8 Riemann surfaces and complex mappings, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose">Roger Penrose</a>)</p>
<p>Only the genius of Riemann, solitary and uncomprehended, had already won its way by the middle of the last century to a new conception of space, in which space was deprived of its rigidity, and in which its power to take part in physical events was recognized as possible. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>)</p>
<p>His contemporaries were to see nothing of him while he waded through Cauchy’s output. Several weeks later Riemann resurfaced, declaring that ‘<strong>this is a new mathematics</strong>’. What had captured Cauchy and Riemann’s imagination was the emerging power of imaginary numbers. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Primes">The Music of the Primes</a>, Riemann’s Imaginary Mathematical Looking-Glass, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a>)</p>
<p>Euclid in Alexandria. Euler in St. Petersburg. The Göttingen trio — Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann. The problem of prime numbers had been passed on like a baton from one generation to another. The new perspectives of each generation provided impetus for a fresh surge along the track. Each wave of mathematicians left its characteristic mark on the primes, a reflection of their era’s particular cultural outlook on the mathematical world. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Primes">The Music of the Primes</a>, chapter 5 The Mathematical RelayRace: Realising Riemann’s Revolution, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a>)</p>
<p>Selberg spoke about his view on the Riemann Hypothesis. Although he had made a major contribution on the way to a proof. he stressed that there was still very little to support its truth. ‘I think the reason that we were tempted to believe the Riemann Hypothesis then was essentially that <strong>it is the most beautiful and simple distribution that we can have. You have this symmetry down the line. It would lead also to the most natural distribution of primes. You think that at least something should be right in this universe.<strong>’<br>Some misinterpreted his comments, thinking that Selberg was casting doubt on the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. Yet he was not as pessimistic as Littlewood who believed the lack of evidence meant the Hypothesis was false. ‘</strong>I have always been a strong believer in the Riemann Hypothesis.</strong> I would never bet against it. But at that stage I maintained that we didn’t really have any results either numerical or theoretical that pointed very strongly to its truth. What the results pointed to was that it was mostly true.’ (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Primes">The Music of the Primes</a>, chapter 7 Mathematical Exodus: From Göttingen to Princeton, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a>)</p>
<p>Many of the mathematicians who have contributed to our understanding of the primes have been rewarded with long lives. Having proved the prime number theorem in 1896, Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vallée-Poussin both lived into their nineties. People had begun to believe that their having proved the Prime Number Theorem had made them immortal. The belief in a connection between longevity and the primes has been further fulled by Atle Selberg and Paul Erdös, whose alternative elementary proof the Prime Number Theorem in the 1940s saw both of them live into their eighties. <strong>Mathematicians joke about a new conjecture: anyone who prove the Riemann Hypothesis will indeed become immortal.</strong> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Primes">The Music of the Primes</a>, Chapter 12 - The Missing Piece of the Jigsaw, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a>)</p>
<p>While for many mathematicians “intuitive work” can be hit-or-miss, <strong>Riemann’s mathematical intuitions were incredibly acute</strong>, and his results generally turned out to be correct.

<p>Every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information. Scientists tell us that the world is warming. Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe. But how do we know if they are right? Why should be believe the science? The fact is, many of us actually don’t believe the science. Public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the American people don’t believe the climate is warming due to human activities, don’t think that there is evolution by natural selection, and aren’t persuaded by the safety of vaccines. </p>
<p>So why should we believe the science? Well, scientists don’t like talking about science as a matter of belief. In fact, they would contrast science with faith, and they would say belief is the domain of faith. And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science. Indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of Pascal’s wager. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> was a 17th-century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God, and his wager went like this: Well, if God doesn’t exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. Maybe a few hours on Sunday. (Laughter) But if he does exist and I don’t believe in him, then I’m in deep trouble. And so Pascal said, we’d better believe in God. Or as one of my college professors said, “He clutched for the handrail of faith.” He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind. </p>
<p>Now the fact is though, for most of us, most scientific claims are a leap of faith. <strong>We can’t really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases. And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties.</strong> So if you think about it, a geologist can’t tell you whether a vaccine is safe. Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory. A physicist cannot tell you, despite the claims of some of them, whether or not tobacco causes cancer. So, <strong>if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields, then why do they accept the claims of other scientists? Why do they believe each other’s claims? And should we believe those claims?</strong></p>
<p>So what I’d like to argue is yes, we should, but not for the reason that most of us think. Most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a>. We were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims. The method that most of us were taught in school, we can call it the textbook method, is the hypothetical deductive method. According to the standard model, the textbook model, scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses, and then they go out into the world and they say, “Okay, well are those consequences true?” Can we observe them taking place in the natural world? And if they are true, then the scientists say, “Great, we know the hypothesis is correct.” </p>
<p>So there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this. One of the most famous examples comes from the work of Albert Einstein. When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity, one of the consequences of his theory was that space-time wasn’t just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. And that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun. So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it. That was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in 1919, and lo and behold it turned out to be true. Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun. This was a huge confirmation of the theory. It was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea, and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe. </p>
<p>Now, sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the <strong>deductive-nomological model</strong>, mainly because <strong>academics like to make things complicated</strong>. But also because in the ideal case, it’s about laws. So nomological means having to do with laws. And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn’t just an idea: ideally, it is a law of nature. Why does it matter that it is a law of nature? Because if it is a law, it can’t be broken. If it’s a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are. And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law: Einstein’s famous equation, (\ E&#x3D;MC^2 \), which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. And that relationship is true no matter what. </p>
<p>Now, it turns out, though, that there are several problems with this model. The main problem is that it’s wrong. It’s just not true. (Laughter) And I’m going to talk about three reasons why it’s wrong. So the first reason is a logical reason. It’s the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. So that’s another fancy, academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions. <strong>So just because the prediction comes true doesn’t actually logically prove that the theory is correct</strong>. And I have a good example of that too, again from the history of science. This is a picture of the <strong>Ptolemaic universe</strong> with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it. The Ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries. Well, why? Well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true. <strong>The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet, in fact more accurate predictions at first than the Copernican theory which we now would say is true</strong>. So that’s one problem with the textbook model. A second problem is a practical problem, and it’s the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. <strong>Auxiliary hypotheses</strong> are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they’re making. So an important example of this comes from the Copernican model, which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system. So when Nicolaus Copernicus said, actually the Earth is not the center of the universe, the sun is the center of the solar system, the Earth moves around the sun. Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that’s true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. And so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax. And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let’s say, Sirius – well I know I’m in Manhattan so you guys can’t see the stars, but imagine you’re out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. If we now make the same observation six months later when the Earth has moved to this position in June, we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop. That difference, that angular difference, is the stellar parallax. So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes. Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing, nothing at all. And many people argued that this proved that the Copernican model was false. </p>
<p>So what happened? Well, in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which we would now say were incorrect. The first was an assumption about the size of the Earth’s orbit. Astronomers were assuming that the Earth’s orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars. Today we would draw the picture more like this, this comes from NASA, and you see the Earth’s orbit is actually quite small. In fact, it’s actually much smaller even than shown here. The stellar parallax therefore, is very small and actually very hard to detect. </p>
<p>And that leads to the second reason why the prediction didn’t work, because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax. And that turned out not to be true. It wasn’t until the 19th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax. </p>
<p>So, there’s a third problem as well. The third problem is simply a factual problem, that a lot of science doesn’t fit the textbook model. <strong>A lot of science isn’t deductive at all, it’s actually inductive.</strong> And by that we mean that scientists don’t necessarily start with theories and hypotheses, often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. And the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. When Darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the Beagle, he didn’t have a hypothesis, he didn’t have a theory. He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. Mainly he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path. So he started collecting data. And he collected many things, including his famous finches. When he collected these finches, he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant. Many years later back in London, Darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation, and that explanation was the theory of natural selection. </p>
<p>Besides inductive science, scientists also often participate in modeling. One of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things. And how do we do that? Well, one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. </p>
<p>So this is a picture of Henry Cadell, who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century. You can tell he’s Scottish because he’s wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. (Laughter) And Cadell wanted to answer the question, how are mountains formed? And one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians, you often find that the rocks in them are folded, and they’re folded in a particular way, which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side. And this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift. So he built this model, this crazy contraption with levers and wood, and here’s his wheelbarrow, buckets, a big sledgehammer. I don’t know why he’s got the Wellington boots. Maybe it’s going to rain. And he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud, that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side. So it was an argument about the cause of mountains. </p>
<p>Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside, so they don’t build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. But a <strong>computer simulation</strong> is a kind of a model. It’s a model that’s made with mathematics, and like the physical models of the 19th century, it’s very important for thinking about causes. So one of the big questions to do with climate change, we have tremendous amounts of evidence that the Earth is warming up. This slide here, the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last 150 years showing that the Earth’s temperature has steadily increased, and you can see in particular that in the last 50 years there’s been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade, or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<p>So what, though, is driving that change? How can we know what’s causing the observed warming? Well, scientists can model it using a computer simulation. So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the Earth’s climate, so sulfate particles from air pollution, volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions, changes in solar radiation, and, of course, greenhouse gases. And they asked the question, what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life? So here is the real life in black. Here’s the model in this light gray, and the answer is a model that includes, it’s the answer E on that SAT, all of the above. The only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together, including greenhouse gases, and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last 50 years. And so this is why climate scientists say it’s not just that we know that climate change is happening, we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. </p>
<p>So now because there all these different things that scientists do, the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said, “The only principle in science that doesn’t inhibit progress is: anything goes.” Now this quotation has often been taken out of context, because Feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes. What he was saying was, actually the full quotation is, “If you press me to say what is the method of science, I would have to say: anything goes.” What he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things. Scientists are creative. </p>
<p>But then this pushes the question back: If scientists don’t use a single method, then how do they decide what’s right and what’s wrong? And who judges? And the answer is, scientists judge, and they judge by judging evidence. Scientists collect evidence in many different ways, but however they collect it, they have to subject it to scrutiny. And this led the sociologist Robert Merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence, and he said they do it in a way he called “organized skepticism.” And by that he meant it’s organized because they do it collectively, they do it as a group, and skepticism, because they do it from a position of distrust. That is to say, the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim. And in this sense, science is intrinsically conservative. It’s quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say, “Yes, we know something, this is true.” So despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts, what we find is that actually, really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science. </p>
<p>So finally that brings us to one more idea: If scientists judge evidence collectively, this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus, and to say that at the end of the day, what science is, what scientific knowledge is, is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny, collective scrutiny, have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it, either yea or nay. </p>
<p>So we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts. <strong>We can also think of science as being a kind of a jury, except it’s a very special kind of jury.</strong> It’s not a jury of your peers, <strong>it’s a jury of geeks. It’s a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s</strong>, and unlike a conventional jury, which has only two choices, guilty or not guilty, the scientific jury actually has a number of choices. Scientists can say yes, something’s true. Scientists can say no, it’s false. Or, they can say, well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence. Or, they can say it might be true, but we don’t know how to answer the question and we’re going to put it aside and maybe we’ll come back to it later. That’s what scientists call “intractable.” </p>
<p>But this leads us to one final problem: <strong>If science is what scientists say it is, then isn’t that just an appeal to authority?</strong> And weren’t we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy? Well, here’s the paradox of modern science, the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to, that actually science is the appeal to authority, but it’s not the authority of the individual, no matter how smart that individual is, like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. <strong>It’s the authority of the collective community. You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd, but a very special kind of crowd. Science does appeal to authority, but it’s not based on any individual, no matter how smart that individual may be. It’s based on the collective wisdom, the collective knowledge, the collective work, of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem.</strong> Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust, this “show me” culture, illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence. Of course, these people don’t really look like scientists, because they’re much too happy. (Laughter) </p>
<p>Okay, so that brings me to my final point. Most of us get up in the morning. Most of us trust our cars. Well, see, now I’m thinking, I’m in Manhattan, this is a bad analogy, but most Americans who don’t live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition, and their cars work, and they work incredibly well. The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. </p>
<p>So why is that? <strong>Why do cars work so well? It’s not because of the genius of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">Henry Ford</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Benz">Karl Benz</a> or even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a>. It’s because the modern automobile is the product of more than 100 years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people. The modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car, and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort. We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car.</strong> And the same is true of science, only science is even older. Our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology, and the same as our basis for trust in anything, namely, experience. </p>
<p>But it shouldn’t be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything. Our trust in science, like science itself, should be based on evidence, and that means that scientists have to become better communicators. They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it, and it means that we have to become better listeners. </p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
<p>(Applause) </p>

        <p>Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical – it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that’s for all of us to imagine <strong>a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge</strong>. </p>
<p>And that’s what we’re doing. So Wikipedia – you just saw the little demonstration of it – it’s a freely licensed encyclopedia. It’s written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. It’s written using wiki software – which is the type of software he just demonstrated – so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And <strong>everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff</strong>. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he’s exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I’m going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside. </p>
<p>So Wikipedia’s owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to <strong>get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet</strong>. And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We’re really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we’re going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that’s a big part of why we’ve chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to – they can take our content and do anything they like with it – you can copy it, redistribute it – and you can do it commercially or non-commercially. </p>
<p>So there’s a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We’re funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I’m going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I’ll show you how big it is. So we’ve got over 600,000 articles in English. We’ve got two million total articles across many, many different languages. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French – all the Western-European languages are quite big. But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we’re truly global. We’re in many, many languages. How popular we’ve gotten to be – we’re a top-50 website and we’re more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai’s discussion. </p>
<p>This shows the growth of Wikipedia – we’re the blue line there – and this is the New York Times over there. And what’s interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer. And he’s only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that … So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we’re organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking, “Well, who’s in charge of this?” or “Who does that?” And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in. It’s a very unusual and chaotic thing. We’ve got over 90 servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we’re doing at Wikipedia. </p>
<p>So we’re doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it’s really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that’s essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you’ve got this really chaotic organization is, why isn’t it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is? </p>
<p>First of all, how good is it? Well, it’s pretty good. It isn’t perfect, but it’s much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, “Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.” But when we’ve seen quality tests – and there haven’t been enough of these yet and I’m really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things – we win hands down. </p>
<p>So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. </p>
<p>So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they – I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it’s tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, “They’re the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.” What I actually said is they’re not contentious at all. So it’s a slight misquote. </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that “Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.” This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for – occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. </p>
<p>Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don’t cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left – that’s where most people assume – but it’s between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn’t because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism – which happens sometimes even on stage … </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said – you know, I always say, please don’t do that. That’s not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work? </p>
<p>So there’s a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that’s completely not debatable. It’s a social concept of cooperation, so we don’t talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we’re only going to write the “truth” about some topic, that doesn’t do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don’t agree with you about what’s the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there’s a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. </p>
<p>So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable from the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don’t become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior, you’ll be asked to leave the community. </p>
<p>So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the “Recent changes” page. So as soon as he made his change, it went to the “Recent changes” page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds – they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers’ watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they’ll just simply revert the change. </p>
<p>There’s a “new pages feed,” for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it’s created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, “ASDFASDF.” But also, that’s some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. </p>
<p>So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change – he didn’t have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that’s a really important thing to understand: the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off-line meetings. </p>
<p>These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they’re doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don’t always meet those standards, but that’s what we’re striving for. </p>
<p>And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. It’s my job to say that, but it’s actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. </p>
<p>The tools and the software: there’s lots of tools that allow us – allow us, meaning the community – to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on “flat Earth,” and you can see some changes that were made. What’s nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, “OK, I understand now.” When somebody goes and looks at – they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it – they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place – to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. So that’s one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page. </p>
<p>Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there’s nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I’ve got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier, people type “ASDFASDF” – it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. There’s no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there’s a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it’s a film, “Twisted Issues,” and the first person says, “Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.” The Google test is you look in Google and see if it’s there, because if something’s not even in Google, it probably doesn’t exist at all. It’s not a perfect rule, but it’s a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, “Delete it, please. Delete it – it’s not notable.” And then somebody says, “Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, ‘Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.’” So the next persons says, “Clean it up.” Somebody says, “I’ve found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep.” </p>
<p>And what’s interesting about this is that the software is – these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, “OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we’ll delete it.” But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, “Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book, and I found a link to a page that describes it, and I’m going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don’t delete it,” then it would survive. </p>
<p>And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say, it’s a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom, “Keep, real movie,” RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he’s doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know about administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus – meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral – some amount of democracy – all of the administrators – these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn’t mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules – but they’re elected by the community. </p>
<p>Sometimes people – random trolls on the Internet – like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they’re elected, actually. There’s a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK’s voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don’t know. </p>
<p>I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community – to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn’t make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, “Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she’s so admired and so powerful.” But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she’s the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she’s the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so … And then there’s monarchy, and that’s my role on the community, so … </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, “I am the Queen of England.” </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>And that’s not exactly what I said, but – </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>the point is my role in the community – Within the free software world, there’s been a long-standing tradition of the “benevolent dictator” model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don’t like the term “benevolent dictator,” and I don’t think that it’s my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn’t appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of – sometimes we have to make a decision and we don’t want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes. </p>
<p>So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, “Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we’re going to get certain articles deleted that we don’t like. And we see they have a voting process, so we’re going to send – we have 40,000 members and we’re going to send them over and they’re all going to vote and get these pages deleted.” Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. That’s neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they’ve got 40,000 members when they’ve got 18. But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said, “But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?” Then I said, “Well, fuck it, we’ll just change the rules.” That’s my job in the community: to say we won’t allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that’s a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave – I can’t tell anyone what to do. </p>
<p>So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it’s important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we’re very flexible about the social methodology, because ultimately, the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia’s success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education? </p>
<p>Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There’s a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is, there’s this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, “Why do academics hate Wikipedia?” I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said, “Well, they don’t all hate it.” </p>
<p>(Laughter) </p>
<p>But I think there’s going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I’m personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that’s a much bigger project. It’s going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition. </p>
<p>But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don’t mean we’re going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we’re going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia that’s written at a university level, it doesn’t do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we’re going to see – it may not even come from us; there’s all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.</p>

<p>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br>With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br>Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br>A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br>Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br>Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br>Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br>The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br>“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she<br>With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,<br>Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”</p>
