<hr>
<p>1<br>00:00:17,280 –&gt; 00:00:21,400<br>Mathematics is about solving problems</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:21,400 –&gt; 00:00:26,240<br>and it’s the great unsolved problems that make maths really alive.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:28,240 –&gt; 00:00:29,440<br>In the summer of 1900,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:29,440 –&gt; 00:00:32,160<br>the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a></p>
<p>5<br>00:00:32,160 –&gt; 00:00:34,440<br>was held here in Paris in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:34,440 –&gt; 00:00:36,680<br>It was a pretty shambolic affair,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:36,680 –&gt; 00:00:39,280<br>not helped by the sultry August heat.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:39,280 –&gt; 00:00:43,000<br>But it will be remembered as one of the greatest congresses of all time</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:43,000 –&gt; 00:00:47,360<br>thanks to a lecture given by the up-and-coming <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:48,880 –&gt; 00:00:51,600<br>Hilbert, a young German mathematician,</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:51,600 –&gt; 00:00:56,360<br>boldly set out what he believed were the 23 most important problems</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:56,360 –&gt; 00:00:58,560<br>for mathematicians to crack.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:58,560 –&gt; 00:01:04,200<br>He was trying to set the agenda for 20th-century maths and he succeeded.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:04,200 –&gt; 00:01:09,480<br>These <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">Hilbert problems</a> would define the mathematics of the modern age.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:09,480 –&gt; 00:01:15,360<br>Of those who tried to crack Hilbert’s challenges, some would experience immense triumphs,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,360 –&gt; 00:01:18,920<br>whilst others would be plunged into infinite despair.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:30,120 –&gt; 00:01:33,120<br>The first problem on Hilbert’s list emerged from here,</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:33,120 –&gt; 00:01:36,320<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_%28Saale%29">Halle</a>, in East Germany.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:36,320 –&gt; 00:01:41,200<br>It was where the great mathematician <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> spent all his adult life.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:41,200 –&gt; 00:01:45,280<br>And where he became the first person to really understand the meaning</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:45,280 –&gt; 00:01:50,160<br>of infinity and give it mathematical precision.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:50,160 –&gt; 00:01:52,480<br>The statue in the town square, however,</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:52,480 –&gt; 00:01:57,360<br>honours Halle’s other famous son, the composer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel">George Handel</a>.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:57,360 –&gt; 00:02:03,600<br>To discover more about Cantor, I had to take a tram way out of town.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:03,600 –&gt; 00:02:07,000<br>For 50 years, Halle was part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">Communist East Germany</a></p>
<p>26<br>00:02:07,000 –&gt; 00:02:10,320<br>and the Communists loved celebrating their scientists.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:10,320 –&gt; 00:02:15,000<br>So much so, they put Cantor on the side of a large cube that they commissioned.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:15,000 –&gt; 00:02:17,640<br>But, being communists, they didn’t put the cube</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:17,640 –&gt; 00:02:20,720<br>in the middle of town. They put it out amongst the people.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:24,320 –&gt; 00:02:27,840<br>When I eventually found the estate, I started to fear</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:27,840 –&gt; 00:02:31,200<br>that maybe I had got the location wrong.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:34,480 –&gt; 00:02:38,680<br>This looks the most unlikely venue for a statue to a mathematician.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:39,960 –&gt; 00:02:41,840<br>Excuse me?</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:42,840 –&gt; 00:02:43,960<br>Ein Frage.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:43,960 –&gt; 00:02:47,560</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you help me a minute?</li>
<li>Wie bitte? </li>
<li>Do you speak English?</li>
<li>No!</li>
<li>No?</li>
</ul>
<p>36<br>00:02:47,560 –&gt; 00:02:49,600<br>Ich suche ein Wurfel.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:49,600 –&gt; 00:02:51,600<br>Ein Wurfel, ja?</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:51,600 –&gt; 00:02:52,880<br>Is that right? A “Wurfel”?</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:52,880 –&gt; 00:02:55,160<br>A cube? Yeah? Like that?</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:55,160 –&gt; 00:02:58,680<br>Mit ein Bild der Mathematiker?</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:58,680 –&gt; 00:03:01,160<br>Yeah? Go round there?</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:01,160 –&gt; 00:03:02,440<br>Die Name ist Cantor.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:02,440 –&gt; 00:03:04,560<br>Somewhere over here. Ah! There it is!</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:04,560 –&gt; 00:03:06,080<br>It’s much bigger than I thought.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:06,080 –&gt; 00:03:09,720<br>I thought it was going to be something like this sort of size.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:09,720 –&gt; 00:03:13,760<br>Aha, here we are. On the dark side of the cube.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:13,760 –&gt; 00:03:16,120<br>here’s the man himself, Cantor.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:16,120 –&gt; 00:03:18,880<br>Cantor’s one of my big heroes actually.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:18,880 –&gt; 00:03:23,040<br>I think if I had to choose some theorems that I wish I’d proved,</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:23,040 –&gt; 00:03:25,040<br>I think the couple that Cantor proved</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:25,040 –&gt; 00:03:27,920<br>would be up there in my top ten.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:27,920 –&gt; 00:03:30,200<br>‘This is because before Cantor,</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:30,200 –&gt; 00:03:33,200<br>‘no-one had really understood infinity.’</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:33,200 –&gt; 00:03:38,080<br>It was a tricky, slippery concept that didn’t seem to go anywhere.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:38,080 –&gt; 00:03:42,680<br>But Cantor showed that infinity could be perfectly understandable.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:42,680 –&gt; 00:03:45,640<br>Indeed, there wasn’t just one infinity,</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:45,640 –&gt; 00:03:48,120<br>but infinitely many infinities.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:48,120 –&gt; 00:03:54,400<br>First Cantor took the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:54,400 –&gt; 00:03:58,000<br>Then he thought about comparing them with a much smaller set…</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:58,000 –&gt; 00:04:02,720<br>something like 10, 20, 30, 40…</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:02,720 –&gt; 00:04:06,320<br>What he showed is that these two infinite sets of numbers</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:06,320 –&gt; 00:04:10,640<br>actually have the same size because we can pair them up -</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:10,640 –&gt; 00:04:14,520<br>1 with 10, 2 with 20, 3 with 30 and so on.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:14,520 –&gt; 00:04:17,880<br>So these are the same sizes of infinity.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:20,640 –&gt; 00:04:22,680<br>But what about the fractions?</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:22,680 –&gt; 00:04:27,520<br>After all, there are infinitely many fractions between any two whole numbers.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:27,520 –&gt; 00:04:30,760<br>Surely the infinity of fractions is much bigger</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:30,760 –&gt; 00:04:33,360<br>than the infinity of whole numbers.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:38,360 –&gt; 00:04:41,600<br>Well, what Cantor did was to find a way to pair up</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:41,600 –&gt; 00:04:45,400<br>all of the whole numbers with an infinite load of fractions.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:45,400 –&gt; 00:04:47,280<br>And this is how he did it.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:47,280 –&gt; 00:04:52,520<br>He started by arranging all the fractions in an infinite grid.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:52,520 –&gt; 00:04:57,160<br>The first row contained the whole numbers, fractions with one on the bottom.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:57,160 –&gt; 00:05:01,720<br>In the second row came the halves, fractions with two on the bottom.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:01,720 –&gt; 00:05:06,280<br>And so on. Every fraction appears somewhere in this grid.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:06,280 –&gt; 00:05:10,320<br>Where’s two thirds? Second column, third row.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:10,320 –&gt; 00:05:15,560<br>Now imagine a line snaking back and forward diagonally through the fractions.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:18,080 –&gt; 00:05:24,920<br>By pulling this line straight, we can match up every fraction with one of the whole numbers.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:24,920 –&gt; 00:05:29,280<br>This means the fractions are the same sort of infinity</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:29,280 –&gt; 00:05:31,080<br>as the whole numbers.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:31,080 –&gt; 00:05:34,120<br>So perhaps all infinities have the same size.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:34,120 –&gt; 00:05:36,680<br>Well, here comes the really exciting bit</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:36,680 –&gt; 00:05:41,080<br>because Cantor now considers the set of all infinite decimal numbers.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:41,080 –&gt; 00:05:45,320<br>And here he proves that they give us a bigger infinity because</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:45,320 –&gt; 00:05:49,320<br>however you tried to list all the infinite decimals, Cantor produced</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:49,320 –&gt; 00:05:52,480<br>a clever argument to show how to construct a new decimal number</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:52,480 –&gt; 00:05:54,200<br>that was missing from your list.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:54,200 –&gt; 00:05:58,240<br>Suddenly, the idea of infinity opens up.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:58,240 –&gt; 00:06:01,840<br>There are different infinities, some bigger than others.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:01,840 –&gt; 00:06:03,600<br>It’s a really exciting moment.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:03,600 –&gt; 00:06:07,880<br>For me, this is like the first humans understanding how to count.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:07,880 –&gt; 00:06:12,120<br>But now we’re counting in a different way. We are counting infinities.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:12,120 –&gt; 00:06:18,080<br>A door has opened and an entirely new mathematics lay before us.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:19,320 –&gt; 00:06:21,480<br>But it never helped Cantor much.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:21,480 –&gt; 00:06:25,240<br>I was in the cemetery in Halle where he is buried</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:25,240 –&gt; 00:06:28,280<br>and where I had arranged to meet Professor Joe Dauben.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:28,280 –&gt; 00:06:32,720<br>He was keen to make the connections between Cantor’s maths and his life.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:33,720 –&gt; 00:06:36,280<br>He suffered from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">manic depression</a>.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:36,280 –&gt; 00:06:39,680<br>One of the first big breakdowns he has is in 1884</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:39,680 –&gt; 00:06:42,160<br>but then around the turn of the century</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:42,160 –&gt; 00:06:44,720<br>these recurrences of the mental illness</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:44,720 –&gt; 00:06:46,760<br>become more and more frequent.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:46,760 –&gt; 00:06:49,720<br>A lot of people have tried to say that his mental illness</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:49,720 –&gt; 00:06:53,120<br>was triggered by the incredible abstract mathematics he dealt with.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:53,120 –&gt; 00:06:57,280<br>Well, he was certainly struggling, so there may have been a connection.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:57,280 –&gt; 00:07:01,920<br>Yeah, I mean I must say, when you start to contemplate the infinite…</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:01,920 –&gt; 00:07:05,080<br>I am pretty happy with the bottom end of the infinite,</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:05,080 –&gt; 00:07:07,240<br>but as you build it up more and more,</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:07,240 –&gt; 00:07:09,920<br>I must say I start to feel a bit unnerved</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:09,920 –&gt; 00:07:13,280<br>about what’s going on here and where is it going.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:13,280 –&gt; 00:07:17,880<br>For much of Cantor’s life, the only place it was going was here -</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:17,880 –&gt; 00:07:20,280<br>the university’s sanatorium.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:20,280 –&gt; 00:07:24,040<br>There was no treatment then for manic depression</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:24,040 –&gt; 00:07:27,920<br>or indeed for the paranoia that often accompanied Cantor’s attacks.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:27,920 –&gt; 00:07:30,800<br>Yet the clinic was a good place to be -</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:30,800 –&gt; 00:07:33,560<br>comfortable, quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:33,560 –&gt; 00:07:37,800<br>And Cantor often found his time here gave him the mental strength</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:37,800 –&gt; 00:07:41,120<br>to resume his exploration of the infinite.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:41,120 –&gt; 00:07:44,480<br>Other mathematicians would be bothered by the paradoxes</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:44,480 –&gt; 00:07:46,400<br>that Cantor’s work had created.</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:46,400 –&gt; 00:07:50,480<br>Curiously, this was one thing Cantor was not worried by.</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:50,480 –&gt; 00:07:53,800<br>He was never as upset about the paradox of the infinite</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:53,800 –&gt; 00:07:56,960<br>as everybody else was because Cantor believed that</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:56,960 –&gt; 00:08:00,240<br>there are certain things that I have been able to show,</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:00,240 –&gt; 00:08:03,640<br>we can establish with complete mathematical certainty</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:03,640 –&gt; 00:08:08,040<br>and then the absolute infinite which is only in God.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:08,040 –&gt; 00:08:12,360<br>He can understand all of this and there’s still that final paradox</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:12,360 –&gt; 00:08:15,400<br>that is not given to us to understand, but God does.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:18,000 –&gt; 00:08:22,280<br>But there was one problem that Cantor couldn’t leave</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:22,280 –&gt; 00:08:23,720<br>in the hands of the Almighty,</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:23,720 –&gt; 00:08:26,320<br>a problem he wrestled with for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:26,320 –&gt; 00:08:29,920<br>It became known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:29,920 –&gt; 00:08:33,200<br>Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:33,200 –&gt; 00:08:37,760<br>of all the whole numbers and the larger infinity of the decimals?</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:40,640 –&gt; 00:08:45,080<br>Cantor’s work didn’t go down well with many of his contemporaries</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:45,080 –&gt; 00:08:48,760<br>but there was one mathematician from France who spoke up for him,</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:48,760 –&gt; 00:08:51,680<br>arguing that Cantor’s new mathematics of infinity</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:51,680 –&gt; 00:08:54,840<br>was “beautiful, if pathological”.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:54,840 –&gt; 00:09:00,480<br>Fortunately this mathematician was the most famous and respected mathematician of his day.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:00,480 –&gt; 00:09:04,160<br>When <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> was asked by a French politician who he thought</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:04,160 –&gt; 00:09:08,720<br>the greatest man France had produced, he replied without hesitation, “Poincare”.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:08,720 –&gt; 00:09:10,840<br>The politician was surprised that he’d chosen</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:10,840 –&gt; 00:09:14,680<br>the prime minister <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Poincar%C3%A9">Raymond Poincare</a> above the likes of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac">Balzac</a>.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:14,680 –&gt; 00:09:19,040<br>Russell replied, “I don’t mean Raymond Poincare but his cousin,</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:19,040 –&gt; 00:09:21,720<br>“the mathematician, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincare</a>.”</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:25,480 –&gt; 00:09:28,720<br>Henri Poincare spent most of his life in Paris,</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:28,720 –&gt; 00:09:32,520<br>a city that he loved even with its uncertain climate.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:32,520 –&gt; 00:09:36,400<br>In the last decades of the 19th century, Paris was a centre</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:36,400 –&gt; 00:09:40,720<br>for world mathematics and Poincare became its leading light.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:40,720 –&gt; 00:09:44,680<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">Algebra</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry">geometry</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis">analysis</a>, he was good at everything.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:44,680 –&gt; 00:09:47,800<br>His work would lead to all kinds of applications,</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:47,800 –&gt; 00:09:50,600<br>from finding your way around on the underground,</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:50,600 –&gt; 00:09:54,280<br>to new ways of predicting the weather.</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:54,280 –&gt; 00:09:57,240<br>Poincare was very strict about his working day.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:57,240 –&gt; 00:09:59,040<br>Two hours of work in the morning</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:59,040 –&gt; 00:10:01,080<br>and two hours in the early evening.</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:01,080 –&gt; 00:10:02,480<br>Between these periods,</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:02,480 –&gt; 00:10:06,160<br>he would let his subconscious carry on working on the problem.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:06,160 –&gt; 00:10:10,240<br>He records one moment when he had a flash of inspiration which occurred</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:10,240 –&gt; 00:10:14,760<br>almost out of nowhere, just as he was getting on a bus.</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:16,720 –&gt; 00:10:21,480<br>And one such flash of inspiration led to an early success.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:21,480 –&gt; 00:10:25,120<br>In 1885, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_II">King Oscar II</a> of Sweden and Norway</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:25,120 –&gt; 00:10:32,320<br>offered a prize of 2,500 crowns for anyone who could establish mathematically once and for all</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:32,320 –&gt; 00:10:36,680<br>whether the solar system would continue turning like clockwork,</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:36,680 –&gt; 00:10:38,640<br>or might suddenly fly apart.</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:38,640 –&gt; 00:10:44,720<br>If the solar system has two planets then Newton had already proved that their orbits would be stable.</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:44,720 –&gt; 00:10:48,720<br>The two bodies just travel in ellipsis round each other.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:48,720 –&gt; 00:10:53,600<br>But as soon as soon as you add three bodies like the earth, moon and sun,</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:53,600 –&gt; 00:10:58,880<br>the question of whether their orbits were stable or not stumped even the great Newton.</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:58,880 –&gt; 00:11:03,040<br>The problem is that now you have some 18 different variables,</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:03,040 –&gt; 00:11:05,280<br>like the exact coordinates of each body</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:05,280 –&gt; 00:11:07,440<br>and their velocity in each direction.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:07,440 –&gt; 00:11:10,720<br>So the equations become very difficult to solve.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:10,720 –&gt; 00:11:15,680<br>But Poincare made significant headway in sorting them out.</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:15,680 –&gt; 00:11:21,720<br>Poincare simplified the problem by making successive approximations to the orbits which he believed</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:21,720 –&gt; 00:11:24,880<br>wouldn’t affect the final outcome significantly.</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:24,880 –&gt; 00:11:28,120<br>Although he couldn’t solve the problem in its entirety,</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:28,120 –&gt; 00:11:33,240<br>his ideas were sophisticated enough to win him the prize.</p>
<p>179<br>00:11:33,240 –&gt; 00:11:36,640<br>He developed this great sort of arsenal of techniques,</p>
<p>180<br>00:11:36,640 –&gt; 00:11:38,320<br>mathematical techniques</p>
<p>181<br>00:11:38,320 –&gt; 00:11:40,880<br>in order to try and solve it</p>
<p>182<br>00:11:40,880 –&gt; 00:11:44,040<br>and in fact, the prize that he won was essentially</p>
<p>183<br>00:11:44,040 –&gt; 00:11:47,520<br>more for the techniques than for solving the problem.</p>
<p>184<br>00:11:47,520 –&gt; 00:11:51,280<br>But when Poincare’s paper was being prepared for publication</p>
<p>185<br>00:11:51,280 –&gt; 00:11:54,320<br>by the King’s scientific advisor, Mittag-Leffler,</p>
<p>186<br>00:11:54,320 –&gt; 00:11:56,360<br>one of the editors found a problem.</p>
<p>187<br>00:11:58,920 –&gt; 00:12:02,440<br>Poincare realised he’d made a mistake.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:02,440 –&gt; 00:12:06,560<br>Contrary to what he had originally thought, even a small change in the</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:06,560 –&gt; 00:12:10,720<br>initial conditions could end up producing vastly different orbits.</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:10,720 –&gt; 00:12:13,440<br>His simplification just didn’t work.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:13,440 –&gt; 00:12:17,040<br>But the result was even more important.</p>
<p>192<br>00:12:17,040 –&gt; 00:12:24,080<br>The orbits Poincare had discovered indirectly led to what we now know as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a>.</p>
<p>193<br>00:12:24,080 –&gt; 00:12:29,120<br>Understanding the mathematical rules of chaos explain why a butterfly’s wings</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:29,120 –&gt; 00:12:31,600<br>could create tiny changes in the atmosphere</p>
<p>195<br>00:12:31,600 –&gt; 00:12:33,320<br>that ultimately might cause</p>
<p>196<br>00:12:33,320 –&gt; 00:12:37,520<br>a tornado or a hurricane to appear on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>197<br>00:12:37,520 –&gt; 00:12:40,400<br>So this big subject of the 20th century, chaos,</p>
<p>198<br>00:12:40,400 –&gt; 00:12:43,600<br>actually came out of a mistake that Poincare made</p>
<p>199<br>00:12:43,600 –&gt; 00:12:45,400<br>and he spotted at the last minute.</p>
<p>200<br>00:12:45,400 –&gt; 00:12:49,040<br>Yes! So the essay had actually been published in its original form,</p>
<p>201<br>00:12:49,040 –&gt; 00:12:54,240<br>and was ready to go out and Mittag-Leffler had sent copies out to various people,</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:54,240 –&gt; 00:12:59,400<br>and it was to his horror when Poincare wrote to him to say, “Stop!”</p>
<p>203<br>00:12:59,400 –&gt; 00:13:03,120<br>Oh, my God. This is every mathematician’s worst nightmare.</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:03,120 –&gt; 00:13:04,640<br>Absolutely. “Pull it!”</p>
<p>205<br>00:13:04,640 –&gt; 00:13:06,160<br>Hold the presses!</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:07,360 –&gt; 00:13:10,280<br>Owning up to his mistake, if anything,</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:10,280 –&gt; 00:13:12,920<br>enhanced Poincare’s reputation.</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:12,920 –&gt; 00:13:15,800<br>He continued to produce a wide range of original work</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:15,800 –&gt; 00:13:16,960<br>throughout his life.</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:16,960 –&gt; 00:13:20,000<br>Not just specialist stuff either.</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:20,000 –&gt; 00:13:24,480<br>He also wrote popular books, extolling the importance of maths.</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:24,480 –&gt; 00:13:28,560<br>Here we go. Here’s a section on the future of mathematics.</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:30,080 –&gt; 00:13:34,240<br>It starts, “If we wish to foresee the future of mathematics,</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:34,240 –&gt; 00:13:39,240<br>“our proper course is to study the history and present the condition of the science.”</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:39,240 –&gt; 00:13:45,000<br>So, I think Poincare might have approved of my journey to uncover the story of maths.</p>
<p>216<br>00:13:45,000 –&gt; 00:13:48,120<br>He certainly would have approved of the next destination.</p>
<p>217<br>00:13:48,120 –&gt; 00:13:53,400<br>Because to discover perhaps Poincare’s most important contribution to modern mathematics,</p>
<p>218<br>00:13:53,400 –&gt; 00:13:56,320<br>I had to go looking for a bridge.</p>
<p>219<br>00:13:59,800 –&gt; 00:14:01,480<br>Seven bridges in fact.</p>
<p>220<br>00:14:01,480 –&gt; 00:14:04,160<br>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Seven bridges of Konigsberg</a>.</p>
<p>221<br>00:14:04,160 –&gt; 00:14:09,280<br>Today the city is known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>, a little outpost</p>
<p>222<br>00:14:09,280 –&gt; 00:14:14,240<br>of Russia on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea">Baltic Sea</a> surrounded by Poland and Lithuania.</p>
<p>223<br>00:14:14,240 –&gt; 00:14:18,000<br>Until 1945, however, when it was ceded to the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>224<br>00:14:18,000 –&gt; 00:14:21,120<br>it was the great Prussian City of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg">Konigsberg</a>.</p>
<p>225<br>00:14:22,640 –&gt; 00:14:25,920<br>Much of the old town sadly has been demolished.</p>
<p>226<br>00:14:25,920 –&gt; 00:14:29,800<br>There is now no sign at all of two of the original seven bridges</p>
<p>227<br>00:14:29,800 –&gt; 00:14:34,400<br>and several have changed out of all recognition.</p>
<p>228<br>00:14:34,400 –&gt; 00:14:38,000<br>This is one of the original bridges.</p>
<p>229<br>00:14:38,000 –&gt; 00:14:44,640<br>It may seem like an unlikely setting for the beginning of a mathematical story, but bear with me.</p>
<p>230<br>00:14:44,640 –&gt; 00:14:47,920<br>It started as an 18th-century puzzle.</p>
<p>231<br>00:14:47,920 –&gt; 00:14:53,160<br>Is there a route around the city which crosses each of these seven bridges only once?</p>
<p>232<br>00:14:53,160 –&gt; 00:14:57,240<br>Finding the solution is much more difficult than it looks.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:07,200 –&gt; 00:15:11,040<br>It was eventually solved by the great mathematician <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>,</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:11,040 –&gt; 00:15:15,400<br>who in 1735 proved that it wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:15,400 –&gt; 00:15:19,680<br>There could not be a route that didn’t cross at least one bridge twice.</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:19,680 –&gt; 00:15:23,200<br>He solved the problem by making a conceptual leap.</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:23,200 –&gt; 00:15:27,440<br>He realised, you don’t really care what the distances are between the bridges.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:27,440 –&gt; 00:15:31,480<br>What really matters is how the bridges are connected together.</p>
<p>239<br>00:15:31,480 –&gt; 00:15:37,920<br>This is a problem of a new sort of geometry of position - a problem of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a>.</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:37,920 –&gt; 00:15:40,960<br>Many of us use topology every day.</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:40,960 –&gt; 00:15:43,440<br>Virtually all metro maps the world over</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:43,440 –&gt; 00:15:46,040<br>are drawn on topological principles.</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:46,040 –&gt; 00:15:49,400<br>You don’t care how far the stations are from each other</p>
<p>244<br>00:15:49,400 –&gt; 00:15:51,200<br>but how they are connected.</p>
<p>245<br>00:15:51,200 –&gt; 00:15:53,840<br>There isn’t a metro in Kaliningrad,</p>
<p>246<br>00:15:53,840 –&gt; 00:15:58,560<br>but there is in the nearest other Russian city, St Petersburg.</p>
<p>247<br>00:15:58,560 –&gt; 00:16:00,720<br>The topology is pretty easy on this map.</p>
<p>248<br>00:16:00,720 –&gt; 00:16:03,200<br>It’s the Russian I am having difficulty with.</p>
<p>249<br>00:16:03,200 –&gt; 00:16:06,360</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you tell me which…? </li>
<li>What’s the problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>250<br>00:16:06,360 –&gt; 00:16:09,760<br>I want to know what station this one was.</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:09,760 –&gt; 00:16:12,840<br>I had it the wrong way round even!</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:14,640 –&gt; 00:16:18,280<br>Although topology had its origins in the bridges of Konigsberg,</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:18,280 –&gt; 00:16:22,520<br>it was in the hands of Poincare that the subject evolved</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:22,520 –&gt; 00:16:26,120<br>into a powerful new way of looking at shape.</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:26,120 –&gt; 00:16:29,840<br>Some people refer to topology as bendy geometry</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:29,840 –&gt; 00:16:34,640<br>because in topology, two shapes are the same if you can bend or morph</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:34,640 –&gt; 00:16:37,240<br>one into another without cutting it.</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:37,240 –&gt; 00:16:42,360<br>So for example if I take a football or rugby ball, topologically they</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:42,360 –&gt; 00:16:46,480<br>are the same because one can be morphed into the other.</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:46,480 –&gt; 00:16:51,960<br>Similarly a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel">bagel</a> and a tea-cup are the same because one can be morphed into the other.</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:51,960 –&gt; 00:16:58,720<br>Even very complicated shapes can be unwrapped to become much simpler from a topological point of view.</p>
<p>262<br>00:16:58,720 –&gt; 00:17:02,760<br>But there is no way to continuously deform a bagel to morph it into a ball.</p>
<p>263<br>00:17:02,760 –&gt; 00:17:06,560<br>The hole in the middle makes these shapes topologically different.</p>
<p>264<br>00:17:06,560 –&gt; 00:17:11,800<br>Poincare knew all the possible two-dimensional topological surfaces.</p>
<p>265<br>00:17:11,800 –&gt; 00:17:15,560<br>But in 1904 he came up with a topological problem</p>
<p>266<br>00:17:15,560 –&gt; 00:17:17,480<br>he just couldn’t solve.</p>
<p>267<br>00:17:17,480 –&gt; 00:17:21,320<br>If you’ve got a flat two-dimensional universe then Poincare worked out</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:21,320 –&gt; 00:17:24,520<br>all the possible shapes he could wrap that universe up into.</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:24,520 –&gt; 00:17:29,600<br>It could be a ball or a bagel with one hole, two holes or more holes in.</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:29,600 –&gt; 00:17:35,200<br>But we live in a three-dimensional universe so what are the possible shapes that our universe can be?</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:35,200 –&gt; 00:17:39,240<br>That question became known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincare Conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:39,240 –&gt; 00:17:43,960<br>It was finally solved in 2002 here in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</a></p>
<p>273<br>00:17:43,960 –&gt; 00:17:47,560<br>by a Russian mathematician called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman">Grisha Perelman</a>.</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:47,560 –&gt; 00:17:51,240<br>His proof is very difficult to understand, even for mathematicians.</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:51,240 –&gt; 00:17:57,960<br>Perelman solved the problem by linking it to a completely different area of mathematics.</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:57,960 –&gt; 00:18:03,800<br>To understand the shapes, he looked instead at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape</p>
<p>277<br>00:18:03,800 –&gt; 00:18:06,880<br>which led to a description of all the possible ways</p>
<p>278<br>00:18:06,880 –&gt; 00:18:11,320<br>that three dimensional space can be wrapped up in higher dimensions.</p>
<p>279<br>00:18:11,320 –&gt; 00:18:16,000<br>I wondered if the man himself could help in unravelling the intricacies of his proof,</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:16,000 –&gt; 00:18:23,400<br>but I’d been told that finding Perelman is almost as difficult as understanding the solution.</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:23,400 –&gt; 00:18:26,040<br>The classic stereotype of a mathematician</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:26,040 –&gt; 00:18:29,800<br>is a mad eccentric scientist, but I think that’s a little bit unfair.</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:29,800 –&gt; 00:18:33,040<br>Most of my colleagues are normal. Well, reasonably.</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:33,040 –&gt; 00:18:35,120<br>But when it comes to Perelman,</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:35,120 –&gt; 00:18:37,920<br>there is no doubt he is a very strange character.</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:37,920 –&gt; 00:18:40,880<br>He’s received prizes and offers of professorships</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:40,880 –&gt; 00:18:43,560<br>from distinguished universities in the West</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:43,560 –&gt; 00:18:46,280<br>but he’s turned them all down.</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:46,280 –&gt; 00:18:49,800<br>Recently he seems to have given up mathematics completely</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:49,800 –&gt; 00:18:52,000<br>and retreated to live as a semi-recluse</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:52,000 –&gt; 00:18:54,720<br>in this very modest housing estate with his mum.</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:54,720 –&gt; 00:19:01,320<br>He refuses to talk to the media but I thought he might just talk to me as a fellow mathematician.</p>
<p>293<br>00:19:01,320 –&gt; 00:19:03,480<br>I was wrong.</p>
<p>294<br>00:19:03,480 –&gt; 00:19:07,320<br>Well, it’s interesting. I think he’s actually turned off his buzzer.</p>
<p>295<br>00:19:07,320 –&gt; 00:19:09,600<br>Probably too many media have been buzzing it.</p>
<p>296<br>00:19:09,600 –&gt; 00:19:12,920<br>I tried a neighbour and that rang but his doesn’t ring at all.</p>
<p>297<br>00:19:12,920 –&gt; 00:19:18,560<br>I think his papers, his mathematics speaks for itself in a way.</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:18,560 –&gt; 00:19:21,080<br>I don’t really need to meet the mathematician</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:21,080 –&gt; 00:19:23,560<br>and in this age of Big Brother and Big Money,</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:23,560 –&gt; 00:19:26,840<br>I think there’s something noble about the fact he gets his kick</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:26,840 –&gt; 00:19:29,520<br>out of proving theorems and not winning prizes.</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:32,960 –&gt; 00:19:36,000<br>One mathematician would certainly have applauded.</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:36,000 –&gt; 00:19:40,440<br>For solving any of his 23 problems, David Hilbert offered no prize</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:40,440 –&gt; 00:19:45,760<br>or reward beyond the admiration of other mathematicians.</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:45,760 –&gt; 00:19:49,360<br>When he sketched out the problems in Paris in 1900,</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:49,360 –&gt; 00:19:52,360<br>Hilbert himself was already a mathematical star.</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:52,360 –&gt; 00:19:56,320<br>And it was in Gottingen in northern Germany that he really shone.</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:59,440 –&gt; 00:20:05,560<br>He was by far the most charismatic mathematician of his age.</p>
<p>309<br>00:20:05,560 –&gt; 00:20:09,960<br>It’s clear that everyone who knew him thought he was absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>310<br>00:20:12,880 –&gt; 00:20:17,600<br>He studied number theory and brought everything together that was there</p>
<p>311<br>00:20:17,600 –&gt; 00:20:20,760<br>and then within a year or so he left that completely</p>
<p>312<br>00:20:20,760 –&gt; 00:20:24,320<br>and revolutionised the theory of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation">integral equation</a>.</p>
<p>313<br>00:20:24,320 –&gt; 00:20:26,880<br>It’s always change and always something new,</p>
<p>314<br>00:20:26,880 –&gt; 00:20:29,840<br>and there’s hardly anybody who is…</p>
<p>315<br>00:20:29,840 –&gt; 00:20:34,800<br>who was so flexible and so varied in his approach as Hilbert was.</p>
<p>316<br>00:20:34,800 –&gt; 00:20:41,800<br>His work is still talked about today and his name has become attached to many mathematical terms.</p>
<p>317<br>00:20:41,800 –&gt; 00:20:46,160<br>Mathematicians still use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert Space</a>, the Hilbert Classification,</p>
<p>318<br>00:20:46,160 –&gt; 00:20:51,120<br>the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_inequality">Hilbert Inequality</a> and several Hilbert theorems.</p>
<p>319<br>00:20:51,120 –&gt; 00:20:54,800<br>But it was his early work on equations that marked him out</p>
<p>320<br>00:20:54,800 –&gt; 00:20:57,520<br>as a mathematician thinking in new ways.</p>
<p>321<br>00:20:57,520 –&gt; 00:21:01,480<br>Hilbert showed that although there are infinitely many equations,</p>
<p>322<br>00:21:01,480 –&gt; 00:21:04,800<br>there are ways to divide them up so that they are built</p>
<p>323<br>00:21:04,800 –&gt; 00:21:08,160<br>out of just a finite set, like a set of building blocks.</p>
<p>324<br>00:21:08,160 –&gt; 00:21:13,880<br>The most striking element of Hilbert’s proof was that he couldn’t actually construct this finite set.</p>
<p>325<br>00:21:13,880 –&gt; 00:21:17,440<br>He just proved it must exist.</p>
<p>326<br>00:21:17,440 –&gt; 00:21:20,760<br>Somebody criticised this as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology">theology</a> and not <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a></p>
<p>327<br>00:21:20,760 –&gt; 00:21:22,400<br>but they’d missed the point.</p>
<p>328<br>00:21:22,400 –&gt; 00:21:26,280<br>What Hilbert was doing here was creating a new style of mathematics,</p>
<p>329<br>00:21:26,280 –&gt; 00:21:28,840<br>a more abstract approach to the subject.</p>
<p>330<br>00:21:28,840 –&gt; 00:21:31,280<br>You could still prove something existed,</p>
<p>331<br>00:21:31,280 –&gt; 00:21:34,240<br>even though you couldn’t construct it explicitly.</p>
<p>332<br>00:21:34,240 –&gt; 00:21:37,960<br>It’s like saying, “I know there has to be a way to get</p>
<p>333<br>00:21:37,960 –&gt; 00:21:42,360<br>“from Gottingen to St Petersburg even though I can’t tell you</p>
<p>334<br>00:21:42,360 –&gt; 00:21:44,440<br>“how to actually get there.”</p>
<p>335<br>00:21:44,440 –&gt; 00:21:49,120<br>As well as challenging mathematical orthodoxies, Hilbert was also happy</p>
<p>336<br>00:21:49,120 –&gt; 00:21:54,840<br>to knock the formal hierarchies that existed in the university system in Germany at the time.</p>
<p>337<br>00:21:54,840 –&gt; 00:22:01,000<br>Other professors were quite shocked to see Hilbert out bicycling and drinking with his students.</p>
<p>338<br>00:22:01,000 –&gt; 00:22:03,440</p>
<ul>
<li>He liked very much parties.</li>
<li>Yeah?</li>
</ul>
<p>339<br>00:22:03,440 –&gt; 00:22:07,240</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Party animal. That’s my kind of mathematician.</li>
</ul>
<p>340<br>00:22:07,240 –&gt; 00:22:13,360<br>He liked very much dancing with young women. He liked very much to flirt.</p>
<p>341<br>00:22:13,360 –&gt; 00:22:17,880<br>Really? Most mathematicians I know are not the biggest of flirts.</p>
<p>342<br>00:22:17,880 –&gt; 00:22:22,000<br>‘Yet this lifestyle went hand in hand with an absolute commitment to maths.’</p>
<p>343<br>00:22:22,000 –&gt; 00:22:26,200<br>Hilbert was of course somebody who thought</p>
<p>344<br>00:22:26,200 –&gt; 00:22:30,240<br>that everybody who has a mathematical skill,</p>
<p>345<br>00:22:30,240 –&gt; 00:22:36,400<br>a penguin, a woman, a man, or black, white or yellow,</p>
<p>346<br>00:22:36,400 –&gt; 00:22:40,280<br>it doesn’t matter, he should do mathematics</p>
<p>347<br>00:22:40,280 –&gt; 00:22:42,360<br>and he should be admired for his.</p>
<p>348<br>00:22:42,360 –&gt; 00:22:46,200<br>The mathematics speaks for itself in a way.</p>
<p>349<br>00:22:46,200 –&gt; 00:22:49,720</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t matter… </li>
<li>When you’re a penguin.</li>
</ul>
<p>350<br>00:22:49,720 –&gt; 00:22:54,360<br>Yeah, if you can prove the Riemann hypothesis, we really don’t mind.</p>
<p>351<br>00:22:54,360 –&gt; 00:22:58,280</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, mathematics was for him a universal language.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>352<br>00:22:58,280 –&gt; 00:23:02,080<br>Hilbert believed that this language was powerful enough</p>
<p>353<br>00:23:02,080 –&gt; 00:23:04,360<br>to unlock all the truths of mathematics,</p>
<p>354<br>00:23:04,360 –&gt; 00:23:07,640<br>a belief he expounded in a radio interview he gave</p>
<p>355<br>00:23:07,640 –&gt; 00:23:11,400<br>on the future of mathematics on the 8th September 1930.</p>
<p>356<br>00:23:16,080 –&gt; 00:23:20,280<br>In it, he had no doubt that all his 23 problems would soon be solved</p>
<p>357<br>00:23:20,280 –&gt; 00:23:23,720<br>and that mathematics would finally be put</p>
<p>358<br>00:23:23,720 –&gt; 00:23:26,840<br>on unshakeable logical foundations.</p>
<p>359<br>00:23:26,840 –&gt; 00:23:30,160<br>There are absolutely no unsolvable problems, he declared,</p>
<p>360<br>00:23:30,160 –&gt; 00:23:32,520<br>a belief that’s been held by mathematicians</p>
<p>361<br>00:23:32,520 –&gt; 00:23:34,480<br>since the time of the Ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>362<br>00:23:34,480 –&gt; 00:23:40,040<br>He ended with this clarion call, “We must know, we will know.”</p>
<p>363<br>00:23:40,040 –&gt; 00:23:44,640<br>‘Wir mussen wissen, wir werden wissen.’</p>
<p>364<br>00:23:45,960 –&gt; 00:23:48,480<br>Unfortunately for him, the very day before</p>
<p>365<br>00:23:48,480 –&gt; 00:23:52,320<br>in a scientific lecture that was not considered worthy of broadcast,</p>
<p>366<br>00:23:52,320 –&gt; 00:23:55,520<br>another mathematician would shatter Hilbert’s dream</p>
<p>367<br>00:23:55,520 –&gt; 00:23:59,480<br>and put uncertainty at the heart of mathematics.</p>
<p>368<br>00:23:59,480 –&gt; 00:24:02,400<br>The man responsible for destroying Hilbert’s belief</p>
<p>369<br>00:24:02,400 –&gt; 00:24:05,520<br>was an Austrian mathematician, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Godel</a>.</p>
<p>370<br>00:24:10,400 –&gt; 00:24:12,440<br>And it all started here - Vienna.</p>
<p>371<br>00:24:12,440 –&gt; 00:24:15,360<br>Even his admirers, and there are a great many,</p>
<p>372<br>00:24:15,360 –&gt; 00:24:19,920<br>admit that Kurt Godel was a little odd.</p>
<p>373<br>00:24:19,920 –&gt; 00:24:23,840<br>As a child, he was bright, sickly and very strange.</p>
<p>374<br>00:24:23,840 –&gt; 00:24:25,880<br>He couldn’t stop asking questions.</p>
<p>375<br>00:24:25,880 –&gt; 00:24:30,720<br>So much so, that his family called him Herr Warum - Mr Why.</p>
<p>376<br>00:24:30,720 –&gt; 00:24:35,160<br>Godel lived in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s,</p>
<p>377<br>00:24:35,160 –&gt; 00:24:38,000<br>between the fall of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a></p>
<p>378<br>00:24:38,000 –&gt; 00:24:39,960<br>and its annexation by the Nazis.</p>
<p>379<br>00:24:39,960 –&gt; 00:24:45,520<br>It was a strange, chaotic and exciting time to be in the city.</p>
<p>380<br>00:24:45,520 –&gt; 00:24:48,160<br>Godel studied mathematics at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna">Vienna University</a></p>
<p>381<br>00:24:48,160 –&gt; 00:24:50,600<br>but he spent most of his time in the cafes,</p>
<p>382<br>00:24:50,600 –&gt; 00:24:52,960<br>the internet chat rooms of their time,</p>
<p>383<br>00:24:52,960 –&gt; 00:24:55,920<br>where amongst games of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon">backgammon</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sports">billiards</a>,</p>
<p>384<br>00:24:55,920 –&gt; 00:24:59,040<br>the real intellectual excitement was taking place.</p>
<p>385<br>00:24:59,040 –&gt; 00:25:02,320<br>Particularly amongst a highly influential group</p>
<p>386<br>00:25:02,320 –&gt; 00:25:05,920<br>of philosophers and scientists called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle">Vienna Circle</a>.</p>
<p>387<br>00:25:05,920 –&gt; 00:25:10,080<br>In their discussions, Kurt Godel would come up with an idea</p>
<p>388<br>00:25:10,080 –&gt; 00:25:13,000<br>that would revolutionise mathematics.</p>
<p>389<br>00:25:13,000 –&gt; 00:25:15,960<br>He’d set himself a difficult mathematical test.</p>
<p>390<br>00:25:15,960 –&gt; 00:25:18,760<br>He wanted to solve <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem">Hilbert’s second problem</a></p>
<p>391<br>00:25:18,760 –&gt; 00:25:22,000<br>and find a logical foundation for all mathematics.</p>
<p>392<br>00:25:22,000 –&gt; 00:25:25,520<br>But what he came up with surprised even him.</p>
<p>393<br>00:25:25,520 –&gt; 00:25:28,960<br>All his efforts in mathematical logic not only couldn’t provide</p>
<p>394<br>00:25:28,960 –&gt; 00:25:33,840<br>the guarantee Hilbert wanted, instead he proved the opposite.</p>
<p>395<br>00:25:33,840 –&gt; 00:25:35,440<br>Got it.</p>
<p>396<br>00:25:35,440 –&gt; 00:25:38,800<br>It’s called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Incompleteness Theorem</a>.</p>
<p>397<br>00:25:38,800 –&gt; 00:25:42,360<br>Godel proved that within any logical system for mathematics</p>
<p>398<br>00:25:42,360 –&gt; 00:25:46,200<br>there will be statements about numbers which are true</p>
<p>399<br>00:25:46,200 –&gt; 00:25:48,200<br>but which you cannot prove.</p>
<p>400<br>00:25:48,200 –&gt; 00:25:53,000<br>He starts with the statement, “This statement cannot be proved.”</p>
<p>401<br>00:25:53,000 –&gt; 00:25:55,480<br>This is not a mathematical statement yet.</p>
<p>402<br>00:25:55,480 –&gt; 00:25:58,360<br>But by using a clever code based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a>,</p>
<p>403<br>00:25:58,360 –&gt; 00:26:03,480<br>Godel could change this statement into a pure statement of arithmetic.</p>
<p>404<br>00:26:03,480 –&gt; 00:26:08,640<br>Now, such statements must be either true or false.</p>
<p>405<br>00:26:08,640 –&gt; 00:26:13,320<br>Hold on to your logical hats as we explore the possibilities.</p>
<p>406<br>00:26:13,320 –&gt; 00:26:17,960<br>If the statement is false, that means the statement could be proved,</p>
<p>407<br>00:26:17,960 –&gt; 00:26:21,320<br>which means it would be true, and that’s a contradiction.</p>
<p>408<br>00:26:21,320 –&gt; 00:26:23,880<br>So that means, the statement must be true.</p>
<p>409<br>00:26:23,880 –&gt; 00:26:28,320<br>In other words, here is a mathematical statement that is true</p>
<p>410<br>00:26:28,320 –&gt; 00:26:30,840<br>but can’t be proved.</p>
<p>411<br>00:26:30,840 –&gt; 00:26:32,440<br>Blast.</p>
<p>412<br>00:26:32,440 –&gt; 00:26:35,520<br>Godel’s proof led to a crisis in mathematics.</p>
<p>413<br>00:26:35,520 –&gt; 00:26:39,320<br>What if the problem you were working on, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture">Goldbach conjecture</a>, say,</p>
<p>414<br>00:26:39,320 –&gt; 00:26:43,600<br>or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>, would turn out to be true but unprovable?</p>
<p>415<br>00:26:43,600 –&gt; 00:26:46,720<br>It led to a crisis for Godel too.</p>
<p>416<br>00:26:46,720 –&gt; 00:26:50,400<br>In the autumn of 1934, he suffered the first of what became</p>
<p>417<br>00:26:50,400 –&gt; 00:26:55,520<br>a series of breakdowns and spent time in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatorium">sanatorium</a>.</p>
<p>418<br>00:26:55,520 –&gt; 00:26:58,960<br>He was saved by the love of a good woman.</p>
<p>419<br>00:26:58,960 –&gt; 00:27:02,880<br>Adele Nimbursky was a dancer in a local night club.</p>
<p>420<br>00:27:02,880 –&gt; 00:27:06,200<br>She kept Godel alive.</p>
<p>421<br>00:27:06,200 –&gt; 00:27:10,040<br>One day, she and Godel were walking down these very steps.</p>
<p>422<br>00:27:10,040 –&gt; 00:27:13,120<br>Suddenly he was attacked by Nazi thugs.</p>
<p>423<br>00:27:13,120 –&gt; 00:27:17,360<br>Godel himself wasn’t Jewish, but many of his friends in the Vienna Circle were.</p>
<p>424<br>00:27:17,360 –&gt; 00:27:19,840<br>Adele came to his rescue.</p>
<p>425<br>00:27:19,840 –&gt; 00:27:24,400<br>But it was only a temporary reprieve for Godel and for maths.</p>
<p>426<br>00:27:24,400 –&gt; 00:27:29,680<br>All across Austria and Germany, mathematics was about to die.</p>
<p>427<br>00:27:33,680 –&gt; 00:27:36,240<br>In the new German empire in the late 1930s</p>
<p>428<br>00:27:36,240 –&gt; 00:27:39,760<br>there weren’t colourful balloons flying over the universities,</p>
<p>429<br>00:27:39,760 –&gt; 00:27:41,600<br>but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika">swastikas</a>.</p>
<p>430<br>00:27:41,600 –&gt; 00:27:46,280<br>The Nazis passed a law allowing the removal of any civil servant</p>
<p>431<br>00:27:46,280 –&gt; 00:27:47,680<br>who wasn’t Aryan.</p>
<p>432<br>00:27:47,680 –&gt; 00:27:51,200<br>Academics were civil servants in Germany then and now.</p>
<p>433<br>00:27:53,520 –&gt; 00:27:56,200<br>Mathematicians suffered more than most.</p>
<p>434<br>00:27:56,200 –&gt; 00:27:59,600<br>144 in Germany would lose their jobs.</p>
<p>435<br>00:27:59,600 –&gt; 00:28:04,040<br>14 were driven to suicide or died in concentration camps.</p>
<p>436<br>00:28:07,680 –&gt; 00:28:10,600<br>But one brilliant mathematician stayed on.</p>
<p>437<br>00:28:10,600 –&gt; 00:28:12,400<br>David Hilbert helped arrange</p>
<p>438<br>00:28:12,400 –&gt; 00:28:15,000<br>for some of his brightest students to flee.</p>
<p>439<br>00:28:15,000 –&gt; 00:28:17,640<br>And he spoke out for a while about the dismissal</p>
<p>440<br>00:28:17,640 –&gt; 00:28:19,200<br>of his Jewish colleagues.</p>
<p>441<br>00:28:19,200 –&gt; 00:28:23,400<br>But soon, he too became silent.</p>
<p>442<br>00:28:26,720 –&gt; 00:28:29,240<br>It’s not clear why he didn’t flee himself</p>
<p>443<br>00:28:29,240 –&gt; 00:28:31,320<br>or at least protest a little more.</p>
<p>444<br>00:28:31,320 –&gt; 00:28:33,600<br>He did fall ill towards the end of his life</p>
<p>445<br>00:28:33,600 –&gt; 00:28:35,800<br>so maybe he just didn’t have the energy.</p>
<p>446<br>00:28:35,800 –&gt; 00:28:38,440<br>All around him, mathematicians and scientists</p>
<p>447<br>00:28:38,440 –&gt; 00:28:42,160<br>were fleeing the Nazi regime until it was only Hilbert left</p>
<p>448<br>00:28:42,160 –&gt; 00:28:47,480<br>to witness the destruction of one of the greatest mathematical centres of all time.</p>
<p>449<br>00:28:50,000 –&gt; 00:28:53,640<br>David Hilbert died in 1943.</p>
<p>450<br>00:28:53,640 –&gt; 00:28:56,360<br>Only ten people attended the funeral</p>
<p>451<br>00:28:56,360 –&gt; 00:28:59,600<br>of the most famous mathematician of his time.</p>
<p>452<br>00:28:59,600 –&gt; 00:29:01,880<br>The dominance of Europe,</p>
<p>453<br>00:29:01,880 –&gt; 00:29:05,680<br>the centre for world maths for 500 years, was over.</p>
<p>454<br>00:29:05,680 –&gt; 00:29:12,000<br>It was time for the mathematical baton to be handed to the New World.</p>
<p>455<br>00:29:13,840 –&gt; 00:29:17,120<br>Time in fact for this place.</p>
<p>456<br>00:29:17,120 –&gt; 00:29:22,040<br>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> had been set up in Princeton in 1930.</p>
<p>457<br>00:29:22,040 –&gt; 00:29:24,880<br>The idea was to reproduce the collegiate atmosphere</p>
<p>458<br>00:29:24,880 –&gt; 00:29:28,880<br>of the old European universities in rural New Jersey.</p>
<p>459<br>00:29:28,880 –&gt; 00:29:32,200<br>But to do this, it needed to attract the very best,</p>
<p>460<br>00:29:32,200 –&gt; 00:29:34,280<br>and it didn’t need to look far.</p>
<p>461<br>00:29:34,280 –&gt; 00:29:37,480<br>Many of the brightest European mathematicians</p>
<p>462<br>00:29:37,480 –&gt; 00:29:39,920<br>were fleeing the Nazis for America.</p>
<p>463<br>00:29:39,920 –&gt; 00:29:42,520<br>People like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, whose research</p>
<p>464<br>00:29:42,520 –&gt; 00:29:45,680<br>would have major significance for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics">theoretical physics</a>.</p>
<p>465<br>00:29:45,680 –&gt; 00:29:48,280<br>And <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John Von Neumann</a>, who developed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a></p>
<p>466<br>00:29:48,280 –&gt; 00:29:50,840<br>and was one of the pioneers of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>.</p>
<p>467<br>00:29:50,840 –&gt; 00:29:55,400<br>The Institute quickly became the perfect place</p>
<p>468<br>00:29:55,400 –&gt; 00:29:59,440<br>to create another Gottingen in the woods.</p>
<p>469<br>00:29:59,440 –&gt; 00:30:04,760<br>One mathematician in particular made the place a home from home.</p>
<p>470<br>00:30:04,760 –&gt; 00:30:06,320<br>Every morning Kurt Godel,</p>
<p>471<br>00:30:06,320 –&gt; 00:30:09,360<br>dressed in a white linen suit and wearing a fedora,</p>
<p>472<br>00:30:09,360 –&gt; 00:30:13,040<br>would walk from his home along Mercer Street to the Institute.</p>
<p>473<br>00:30:13,040 –&gt; 00:30:16,520<br>On his way, he would stop here at number 112,</p>
<p>474<br>00:30:16,520 –&gt; 00:30:22,640<br>to pick up his closest friend, another European exile, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>.</p>
<p>475<br>00:30:22,640 –&gt; 00:30:26,960<br>But not even relaxed, affluent Princeton could help Godel</p>
<p>476<br>00:30:26,960 –&gt; 00:30:29,040<br>finally escape his demons.</p>
<p>477<br>00:30:29,040 –&gt; 00:30:31,640<br>Einstein was always full of laughter.</p>
<p>478<br>00:30:31,640 –&gt; 00:30:35,520<br>He described Princeton as a banishment to paradise.</p>
<p>479<br>00:30:35,520 –&gt; 00:30:40,080<br>But the much younger Godel became increasingly solemn and pessimistic.</p>
<p>480<br>00:30:43,160 –&gt; 00:30:46,400<br>Slowly this pessimism turned into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia">paranoia</a>.</p>
<p>481<br>00:30:46,400 –&gt; 00:30:50,520<br>He spent less and less time with his fellow mathematicians in Princeton.</p>
<p>482<br>00:30:50,520 –&gt; 00:30:54,200<br>Instead, he preferred to come here to the beach, next to the ocean,</p>
<p>483<br>00:30:54,200 –&gt; 00:30:59,240<br>walk alone, thinking about the works of the great German mathematician, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>.</p>
<p>484<br>00:31:01,400 –&gt; 00:31:05,320<br>But as Godel was withdrawing into his own interior world,</p>
<p>485<br>00:31:05,320 –&gt; 00:31:09,320<br>his influence on American mathematics paradoxically</p>
<p>486<br>00:31:09,320 –&gt; 00:31:12,000<br>was growing stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>487<br>00:31:12,000 –&gt; 00:31:16,160<br>And a young mathematician from just along the New Jersey coast</p>
<p>488<br>00:31:16,160 –&gt; 00:31:19,840<br>eagerly took on some of the challenges he posed.</p>

<p>492<br>00:31:27,040 –&gt; 00:31:31,440<br>the majority of youngsters weren’t preoccupied with mathematics.</p>
<p>493<br>00:31:31,440 –&gt; 00:31:35,160<br>Most went for a more relaxed, hedonistic lifestyle</p>
<p>494<br>00:31:35,160 –&gt; 00:31:38,840<br>in this newly affluent land of ice-cream and doughnuts.</p>
<p>495<br>00:31:38,840 –&gt; 00:31:42,560<br>But one teenager didn’t indulge in the normal pursuits</p>
<p>496<br>00:31:42,560 –&gt; 00:31:45,640<br>of American adolescence but chose instead</p>
<p>497<br>00:31:45,640 –&gt; 00:31:49,200<br>to grapple with some of the major problems in mathematics.</p>
<p>498<br>00:31:49,200 –&gt; 00:31:50,680<br>From a very early age,</p>
<p>499<br>00:31:50,680 –&gt; 00:31:55,080<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a> was winning mathematical competitions and prizes.</p>
<p>500<br>00:31:55,080 –&gt; 00:31:58,960<br>But he found it difficult at first to discover a field in mathematics</p>
<p>501<br>00:31:58,960 –&gt; 00:32:01,280<br>where he could really make his mark…</p>
<p>502<br>00:32:01,280 –&gt; 00:32:05,720<br>Until he read about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Cantor</a>‘s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>503<br>00:32:05,720 –&gt; 00:32:09,280<br>That’s the one problem, as I had learned back in Halle,</p>
<p>504<br>00:32:09,280 –&gt; 00:32:11,760<br>that Cantor just couldn’t resolve.</p>
<p>505<br>00:32:11,760 –&gt; 00:32:15,400<br>It asks whether there is or there isn’t an infinite set of numbers</p>
<p>506<br>00:32:15,400 –&gt; 00:32:18,080<br>bigger than the set of all whole numbers</p>
<p>507<br>00:32:18,080 –&gt; 00:32:20,960<br>but smaller than the set of all decimals.</p>
<p>508<br>00:32:20,960 –&gt; 00:32:24,280<br>It sounds straightforward, but it had foiled all attempts</p>
<p>509<br>00:32:24,280 –&gt; 00:32:29,160<br>to solve it since Hilbert made it his first problem way back in 1900.</p>
<p>510<br>00:32:29,160 –&gt; 00:32:31,480<br>With the arrogance of youth,</p>
<p>511<br>00:32:31,480 –&gt; 00:32:36,040<br>the 22-year-old Paul Cohen decided that he could do it.</p>
<p>512<br>00:32:36,040 –&gt; 00:32:40,720<br>Cohen came back a year later with the extraordinary discovery</p>
<p>513<br>00:32:40,720 –&gt; 00:32:43,200<br>that both answers could be true.</p>
<p>514<br>00:32:43,200 –&gt; 00:32:47,160<br>There was one mathematics where the continuum hypothesis</p>
<p>515<br>00:32:47,160 –&gt; 00:32:49,080<br>could be assumed to be true.</p>
<p>516<br>00:32:49,080 –&gt; 00:32:51,800<br>There wasn’t a set between the whole numbers</p>
<p>517<br>00:32:51,800 –&gt; 00:32:53,440<br>and the infinite decimals.</p>
<p>518<br>00:32:55,160 –&gt; 00:32:59,200<br>But there was an equally consistent mathematics</p>
<p>519<br>00:32:59,200 –&gt; 00:33:03,440<br>where the continuum hypothesis could be assumed to be false.</p>
<p>520<br>00:33:03,440 –&gt; 00:33:08,280<br>Here, there was a set between the whole numbers and the infinite decimals.</p>
<p>521<br>00:33:08,280 –&gt; 00:33:11,480<br>It was an incredibly daring solution.</p>
<p>522<br>00:33:11,480 –&gt; 00:33:13,840<br>Cohen’s proof seemed true,</p>
<p>523<br>00:33:13,840 –&gt; 00:33:19,160<br>but his method was so new that nobody was absolutely sure.</p>
<p>524<br>00:33:19,160 –&gt; 00:33:22,720<br>There was only one person whose opinion everybody trusted.</p>
<p>525<br>00:33:22,720 –&gt; 00:33:26,640<br>There was a lot of scepticism and he had to come and make a trip here,</p>
<p>526<br>00:33:26,640 –&gt; 00:33:29,320<br>to the Institute right here, to visit Godel.</p>
<p>527<br>00:33:29,320 –&gt; 00:33:32,720<br>And it was only after Godel gave his stamp of approval</p>
<p>528<br>00:33:32,720 –&gt; 00:33:34,240<br>in quite an unusual way,</p>
<p>529<br>00:33:34,240 –&gt; 00:33:37,880<br>He said, “Give me your paper”, and then on Monday he put it back</p>
<p>530<br>00:33:37,880 –&gt; 00:33:40,360<br>in the box and said, “Yes, it’s correct.”</p>
<p>531<br>00:33:40,360 –&gt; 00:33:42,040<br>Then everything changed.</p>
<p>532<br>00:33:43,240 –&gt; 00:33:46,200<br>Today mathematicians insert a statement</p>
<p>533<br>00:33:46,200 –&gt; 00:33:50,840<br>that says whether the result depends on the continuum hypothesis.</p>
<p>534<br>00:33:50,840 –&gt; 00:33:54,880<br>We’ve built up two different mathematical worlds</p>
<p>535<br>00:33:54,880 –&gt; 00:33:57,320<br>in which one answer is yes and the other is no.</p>
<p>536<br>00:33:57,320 –&gt; 00:34:01,440<br>Paul Cohen really has rocked the mathematical universe.</p>
<p>537<br>00:34:01,440 –&gt; 00:34:05,680<br>It gave him fame, riches, and prizes galore.</p>
<p>538<br>00:34:07,680 –&gt; 00:34:12,880<br>He didn’t publish much after his early success in the ‘60s.</p>
<p>539<br>00:34:12,880 –&gt; 00:34:15,040<br>But he was absolutely dynamite.</p>
<p>540<br>00:34:15,040 –&gt; 00:34:18,840<br>I can’t imagine anyone better to learn from, and he was very eager</p>
<p>541<br>00:34:18,840 –&gt; 00:34:23,840<br>to learn, to teach you anything he knew or even things he didn’t know.</p>
<p>542<br>00:34:23,840 –&gt; 00:34:27,640<br>With the confidence that came from solving Hilbert’s first problem,</p>
<p>543<br>00:34:27,640 –&gt; 00:34:30,320<br>Cohen settled down in the mid 1960s</p>
<p>544<br>00:34:30,320 –&gt; 00:34:34,440<br>to have a go at the most important Hilbert problem of them all -</p>
<p>545<br>00:34:34,440 –&gt; 00:34:36,960<br>the eighth, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>546<br>00:34:36,960 –&gt; 00:34:43,000<br>When he died in California in 2007, 40 years later, he was still trying.</p>
<p>547<br>00:34:43,000 –&gt; 00:34:46,200<br>But like many famous mathematicians before him,</p>
<p>548<br>00:34:46,200 –&gt; 00:34:48,280<br>Riemann had defeated even him.</p>
<p>549<br>00:34:48,280 –&gt; 00:34:52,440<br>But his approach has inspired others to make progress towards a proof,</p>
<p>550<br>00:34:52,440 –&gt; 00:34:55,560<br>including one of his most famous students, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sarnak">Peter Sarnak</a>.</p>
<p>551<br>00:34:55,560 –&gt; 00:34:59,440<br>I think, overall, absolutely loved the guy.</p>
<p>552<br>00:34:59,440 –&gt; 00:35:01,840<br>He was my inspiration.</p>
<p>553<br>00:35:01,840 –&gt; 00:35:04,600<br>I’m really glad I worked with him.</p>
<p>554<br>00:35:04,600 –&gt; 00:35:06,800<br>He put me on the right track.</p>
<p>555<br>00:35:09,960 –&gt; 00:35:14,240<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a> is a good example of the success of the great <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream">American Dream</a>.</p>
<p>556<br>00:35:14,240 –&gt; 00:35:16,800<br>The second generation Jewish immigrant</p>
<p>557<br>00:35:16,800 –&gt; 00:35:18,960<br>becomes top American professor.</p>
<p>558<br>00:35:18,960 –&gt; 00:35:23,640<br>But I wouldn’t say that his mathematics was a particularly American product.</p>
<p>559<br>00:35:23,640 –&gt; 00:35:25,720<br>Cohen was so fired up by this problem</p>
<p>560<br>00:35:25,720 –&gt; 00:35:29,680<br>that he probably would have cracked it whatever the surroundings.</p>
<p>561<br>00:35:31,200 –&gt; 00:35:33,680<br>Paul Cohen had it relatively easy.</p>
<p>562<br>00:35:33,680 –&gt; 00:35:36,640<br>But another great American mathematician of the 1960s</p>
<p>563<br>00:35:36,640 –&gt; 00:35:40,320<br>faced a much tougher struggle to make an impact.</p>
<p>564<br>00:35:40,320 –&gt; 00:35:43,440<br>Not least because she was female.</p>
<p>565<br>00:35:43,440 –&gt; 00:35:48,240<br>In the story of maths, nearly all the truly great mathematicians have been men.</p>
<p>566<br>00:35:48,240 –&gt; 00:35:51,560<br>But there have been a few exceptions.</p>
<p>567<br>00:35:51,560 –&gt; 00:35:54,000<br>There was the Russian <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofya_Kovalevskaya">Sofia Kovalevskaya</a></p>
<p>568<br>00:35:54,000 –&gt; 00:35:58,920<br>who became the first female professor of mathematics in Stockholm in 1889,</p>
<p>569<br>00:35:58,920 –&gt; 00:36:03,400<br>and won a very prestigious French mathematical prize.</p>
<p>570<br>00:36:03,400 –&gt; 00:36:07,080<br>And then <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</a>, a talented algebraist who fled from the Nazis</p>
<p>571<br>00:36:07,080 –&gt; 00:36:10,600<br>to America but then died before she fully realised her potential.</p>
<p>572<br>00:36:10,600 –&gt; 00:36:15,920<br>Then there is the woman who I am crossing America to find out about.</p>
<p>573<br>00:36:15,920 –&gt; 00:36:19,680<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Robinson">Julia Robinson</a>, the first woman ever to be elected president</p>
<p>574<br>00:36:19,680 –&gt; 00:36:22,080<br>of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society">American Mathematical Society</a>.</p>
<p>575<br>00:36:31,440 –&gt; 00:36:34,840<br>She was born in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis">St Louis</a> in 1919,</p>
<p>576<br>00:36:34,840 –&gt; 00:36:38,160<br>but her mother died when she was two.</p>
<p>577<br>00:36:38,160 –&gt; 00:36:42,360<br>She and her sister Constance moved to live with their grandmother</p>
<p>578<br>00:36:42,360 –&gt; 00:36:45,720<br>in a small community in the desert near <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>579<br>00:36:47,720 –&gt; 00:36:49,800<br>Julia Robinson grew up around here.</p>
<p>580<br>00:36:49,800 –&gt; 00:36:53,440<br>I’ve got a photo which shows her cottage in the 1930s,</p>
<p>581<br>00:36:53,440 –&gt; 00:36:55,480<br>with nothing much around it.</p>
<p>582<br>00:36:55,480 –&gt; 00:36:58,160<br>The mountains pretty much match those over there</p>
<p>583<br>00:36:58,160 –&gt; 00:37:00,640<br>so I think she might have lived down there.</p>
<p>584<br>00:37:01,600 –&gt; 00:37:04,160<br>Julia grew up a shy, sickly girl,</p>
<p>585<br>00:37:04,160 –&gt; 00:37:09,440<br>who, when she was seven, spent a year in bed because of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever">scarlet fever</a>.</p>
<p>586<br>00:37:09,440 –&gt; 00:37:12,240<br>Ill-health persisted throughout her childhood.</p>
<p>587<br>00:37:12,240 –&gt; 00:37:15,120<br>She was told she wouldn’t live past 40.</p>
<p>588<br>00:37:15,120 –&gt; 00:37:20,400<br>But right from the start, she had an innate mathematical ability.</p>
<p>589<br>00:37:20,400 –&gt; 00:37:25,240<br>Under the shade of the native Arizona cactus, she whiled away the time</p>
<p>590<br>00:37:25,240 –&gt; 00:37:28,720<br>playing endless counting games with stone pebbles.</p>
<p>591<br>00:37:28,720 –&gt; 00:37:31,960<br>This early searching for patterns would give her a feel</p>
<p>592<br>00:37:31,960 –&gt; 00:37:35,320<br>and love of numbers that would last for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>593<br>00:37:35,320 –&gt; 00:37:39,160<br>But despite showing an early brilliance, she had to continually</p>
<p>594<br>00:37:39,160 –&gt; 00:37:44,080<br>fight at school and college to simply be allowed to keep doing maths.</p>
<p>595<br>00:37:44,080 –&gt; 00:37:47,920<br>As a teenager, she was the only girl in the maths class</p>
<p>596<br>00:37:47,920 –&gt; 00:37:50,600<br>but had very little encouragement.</p>
<p>597<br>00:37:50,600 –&gt; 00:37:55,480<br>The young Julia sought intellectual stimulation elsewhere.</p>
<p>598<br>00:37:55,480 –&gt; 00:37:59,440<br>Julia loved listening to a radio show called the University Explorer</p>
<p>599<br>00:37:59,440 –&gt; 00:38:02,440<br>and the 53rd episode was all about mathematics.</p>
<p>600<br>00:38:02,440 –&gt; 00:38:04,960<br>The broadcaster described how he discovered</p>
<p>601<br>00:38:04,960 –&gt; 00:38:08,560<br>despite their esoteric language and their seclusive nature,</p>
<p>602<br>00:38:08,560 –&gt; 00:38:12,320<br>mathematicians are the most interesting and inspiring creatures.</p>
<p>603<br>00:38:12,320 –&gt; 00:38:16,240<br>For the first time, Julia had found out that there were mathematicians,</p>
<p>604<br>00:38:16,240 –&gt; 00:38:17,920<br>not just mathematics teachers.</p>
<p>605<br>00:38:17,920 –&gt; 00:38:20,440<br>There was a world of mathematics out there,</p>
<p>606<br>00:38:20,440 –&gt; 00:38:22,240<br>and she wanted to be part of it.</p>
<p>607<br>00:38:26,080 –&gt; 00:38:29,680<br>The doors to that world opened here at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California">University of California</a>,</p>
<p>608<br>00:38:29,680 –&gt; 00:38:31,960<br>at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California">Berkeley</a> near <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>609<br>00:38:33,760 –&gt; 00:38:38,680<br>She was absolutely obsessed that she wanted to go to Berkeley.</p>
<p>610<br>00:38:38,680 –&gt; 00:38:44,200<br>She wanted to go away to some place where there were mathematicians.</p>
<p>611<br>00:38:44,200 –&gt; 00:38:46,720<br>Berkeley certainly had mathematicians,</p>
<p>612<br>00:38:46,720 –&gt; 00:38:50,320<br>including a number theorist called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_M._Robinson">Raphael Robinson</a>.</p>
<p>613<br>00:38:50,320 –&gt; 00:38:53,400<br>In their frequent walks around the campus</p>
<p>614<br>00:38:53,400 –&gt; 00:38:59,960<br>they found they had more than just a passion for mathematics. They married in 1952.</p>
<p>615<br>00:38:59,960 –&gt; 00:39:03,200<br>Julia got her PhD and settled down</p>
<p>616<br>00:39:03,200 –&gt; 00:39:05,720<br>to what would turn into her lifetime’s work -</p>
<p>617<br>00:39:05,720 –&gt; 00:39:07,280<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">Hilbert’s tenth problem</a>.</p>
<p>618<br>00:39:07,280 –&gt; 00:39:10,000<br>She thought about it all the time.</p>
<p>619<br>00:39:10,000 –&gt; 00:39:14,120<br>She said to me she just wouldn’t wanna die without knowing that answer</p>
<p>620<br>00:39:14,120 –&gt; 00:39:16,240<br>and it had become an obsession.</p>
<p>621<br>00:39:17,280 –&gt; 00:39:21,200<br>Julia’s obsession has been shared with many other mathematicians</p>
<p>622<br>00:39:21,200 –&gt; 00:39:24,560<br>since Hilbert had first posed it back in 1900.</p>
<p>623<br>00:39:24,560 –&gt; 00:39:28,400<br>His tenth problem asked if there was some universal method</p>
<p>624<br>00:39:28,400 –&gt; 00:39:34,200<br>that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not.</p>
<p>625<br>00:39:34,200 –&gt; 00:39:36,520<br>Nobody had been able to solve it.</p>
<p>626<br>00:39:36,520 –&gt; 00:39:39,520<br>In fact, the growing belief was</p>
<p>627<br>00:39:39,520 –&gt; 00:39:42,440<br>that no such universal method was possible.</p>
<p>628<br>00:39:42,440 –&gt; 00:39:44,520<br>How on earth could you prove that,</p>
<p>629<br>00:39:44,520 –&gt; 00:39:48,400<br>however ingenious you were, you’d never come up with a method?</p>
<p>630<br>00:39:50,080 –&gt; 00:39:51,800<br>With the help of colleagues,</p>
<p>631<br>00:39:51,800 –&gt; 00:39:55,640<br>Julia developed what became known as the Robinson hypothesis.</p>
<p>632<br>00:39:55,640 –&gt; 00:39:58,920<br>This argued that to show no such method existed,</p>
<p>633<br>00:39:58,920 –&gt; 00:40:03,280<br>all you had to do was to cook up one equation whose solutions</p>
<p>634<br>00:40:03,280 –&gt; 00:40:06,040<br>were a very specific set of numbers.</p>
<p>635<br>00:40:06,040 –&gt; 00:40:09,280<br>The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially,</p>
<p>636<br>00:40:09,280 –&gt; 00:40:13,960<br>like taking powers of two, yet still be captured by the equations</p>
<p>637<br>00:40:13,960 –&gt; 00:40:16,520<br>at the heart of Hilbert’s problem.</p>
<p>638<br>00:40:16,520 –&gt; 00:40:21,600<br>Try as she might, Robinson just couldn’t find this set.</p>
<p>639<br>00:40:21,600 –&gt; 00:40:25,880<br>For the tenth problem to be finally solved,</p>
<p>640<br>00:40:25,880 –&gt; 00:40:28,880<br>there needed to be some fresh inspiration.</p>
<p>641<br>00:40:28,880 –&gt; 00:40:34,280<br>That came from 5,000 miles away - St Petersburg in Russia.</p>
<p>642<br>00:40:34,280 –&gt; 00:40:37,840<br>Ever since the great <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> set up shop here</p>
<p>643<br>00:40:37,840 –&gt; 00:40:39,040<br>in the 18th century,</p>
<p>644<br>00:40:39,040 –&gt; 00:40:42,960<br>the city has been famous for its mathematics and mathematicians.</p>
<p>645<br>00:40:42,960 –&gt; 00:40:44,760<br>Here in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steklov_Institute_of_Mathematics">Steklov Institute</a>,</p>
<p>646<br>00:40:44,760 –&gt; 00:40:47,480<br>some of the world’s brightest mathematicians</p>
<p>647<br>00:40:47,480 –&gt; 00:40:50,160<br>have set out their theorems and conjectures.</p>
<p>648<br>00:40:50,160 –&gt; 00:40:54,320<br>This morning, one of them is giving a rare seminar.</p>
<p>649<br>00:40:57,120 –&gt; 00:41:00,040<br>It’s tough going even if you speak Russian,</p>
<p>650<br>00:41:00,040 –&gt; 00:41:02,080<br>which unfortunately I don’t.</p>
<p>651<br>00:41:02,080 –&gt; 00:41:06,320<br>But we do get a break in the middle to recover before the final hour.</p>
<p>652<br>00:41:06,320 –&gt; 00:41:08,320<br>There is a kind of rule in seminars.</p>
<p>653<br>00:41:08,320 –&gt; 00:41:12,880<br>The first third is for everyone, the second third for the experts</p>
<p>654<br>00:41:12,880 –&gt; 00:41:16,080<br>and the last third is just for the lecturer.</p>
<p>655<br>00:41:16,080 –&gt; 00:41:19,080<br>I think that’s what we’re going to get next.</p>
<p>656<br>00:41:19,080 –&gt; 00:41:22,800<br>The lecturer is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Matiyasevich">Yuri Matiyasevich</a> and he is explaining</p>
<p>657<br>00:41:22,800 –&gt; 00:41:26,520<br>his latest work on - what else? - the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>658<br>00:41:28,720 –&gt; 00:41:33,160<br>As a bright young graduate student in 1965, Yuri’s tutor</p>
<p>659<br>00:41:33,160 –&gt; 00:41:36,000<br>suggested he have a go at another Hilbert problem,</p>
<p>660<br>00:41:36,000 –&gt; 00:41:39,000<br>the one that had in fact preoccupied <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Robinson">Julia Robinson</a>.</p>
<p>661<br>00:41:39,000 –&gt; 00:41:40,280<br>Hilbert’s tenth.</p>
<p>662<br>00:41:43,160 –&gt; 00:41:45,080<br>It was the height of the Cold War.</p>
<p>663<br>00:41:45,080 –&gt; 00:41:48,440<br>Perhaps Matiyasevich could succeed for Russia</p>
<p>664<br>00:41:48,440 –&gt; 00:41:52,080<br>where Julia and her fellow American mathematicians had failed.</p>
<p>665<br>00:41:52,080 –&gt; 00:41:55,000</p>
<ul>
<li>At first I did not like their approach.</li>
<li>Oh, right.</li>
</ul>
<p>666<br>00:41:55,000 –&gt; 00:41:59,640<br>The statement looked to me rather strange and artificial</p>
<p>667<br>00:41:59,640 –&gt; 00:42:03,520<br>but after some time I understood it was quite natural,</p>
<p>668<br>00:42:03,520 –&gt; 00:42:07,200<br>and then I understood that she had a new brilliant idea</p>
<p>669<br>00:42:07,200 –&gt; 00:42:10,000<br>and I just started to further develop it.</p>
<p>670<br>00:42:11,520 –&gt; 00:42:17,000<br>In January 1970, he found the vital last piece in the jigsaw.</p>
<p>671<br>00:42:17,000 –&gt; 00:42:21,880<br>He saw how to capture the famous <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a> of numbers</p>
<p>672<br>00:42:21,880 –&gt; 00:42:26,040<br>using the equations that were at the heart of Hilbert’s problem.</p>
<p>673<br>00:42:26,040 –&gt; 00:42:28,920<br>Building on the work of Julia and her colleagues,</p>
<p>674<br>00:42:28,920 –&gt; 00:42:30,720<br>he had solved the tenth.</p>
<p>675<br>00:42:30,720 –&gt; 00:42:34,240<br>He was just 22 years old.</p>
<p>676<br>00:42:34,240 –&gt; 00:42:37,920<br>The first person he wanted to tell was the woman he owed so much to.</p>
<p>677<br>00:42:39,800 –&gt; 00:42:41,720<br>I got no answer</p>
<p>678<br>00:42:41,720 –&gt; 00:42:44,600<br>and I believed they were lost in the mail.</p>
<p>679<br>00:42:44,600 –&gt; 00:42:47,720<br>It was quite natural because it was Soviet time.</p>
<p>680<br>00:42:47,720 –&gt; 00:42:50,800<br>But back in California, Julia had heard rumours</p>
<p>681<br>00:42:50,800 –&gt; 00:42:54,840<br>through the mathematical grapevine that the problem had been solved.</p>
<p>682<br>00:42:54,840 –&gt; 00:42:57,120<br>And she contacted Yuri herself.</p>
<p>683<br>00:42:58,120 –&gt; 00:43:01,480<br>She said, I just had to wait for you to grow up</p>
<p>684<br>00:43:01,480 –&gt; 00:43:06,160<br>to get the answer, because she had started work in 1948.</p>
<p>685<br>00:43:06,160 –&gt; 00:43:07,960<br>When Yuri was just a baby.</p>
<p>686<br>00:43:07,960 –&gt; 00:43:11,240<br>Then he responds by thanking her</p>
<p>687<br>00:43:11,240 –&gt; 00:43:16,160<br>and saying that the credit is as much hers as it is his.</p>
<p>688<br>00:43:18,240 –&gt; 00:43:20,520<br>YURI: I met Julia one year later.</p>
<p>689<br>00:43:20,520 –&gt; 00:43:25,080<br>It was in Bucharest. I suggested after the conference in Bucharest</p>
<p>690<br>00:43:25,080 –&gt; 00:43:30,120<br>Julia and her husband Raphael came to see me here in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg">Leningrad</a>.</p>
<p>691<br>00:43:30,120 –&gt; 00:43:35,400<br>Together, Julia and Yuri worked on several other mathematical problems</p>
<p>692<br>00:43:35,400 –&gt; 00:43:39,160<br>until shortly before Julia died in 1985.</p>
<p>693<br>00:43:39,160 –&gt; 00:43:41,960<br>She was just 55 years old.</p>
<p>694<br>00:43:41,960 –&gt; 00:43:45,640<br>She was able to find the new ways.</p>
<p>695<br>00:43:45,640 –&gt; 00:43:49,640<br>Many mathematicians just combine previous known methods</p>
<p>696<br>00:43:49,640 –&gt; 00:43:55,560<br>to solve new problems and she had really new ideas.</p>
<p>697<br>00:43:55,560 –&gt; 00:43:59,160<br>Although Julia Robinson showed there was no universal method</p>
<p>698<br>00:43:59,160 –&gt; 00:44:01,560<br>to solve all equations in whole numbers,</p>
<p>699<br>00:44:01,560 –&gt; 00:44:05,840<br>mathematicians were still interested in finding methods</p>
<p>700<br>00:44:05,840 –&gt; 00:44:08,760<br>to solve special classes of equations.</p>
<p>701<br>00:44:08,760 –&gt; 00:44:11,320<br>It would be in France in the early 19th century,</p>
<p>702<br>00:44:11,320 –&gt; 00:44:13,560<br>in one of the most extraordinary stories</p>
<p>703<br>00:44:13,560 –&gt; 00:44:17,120<br>in the history of mathematics, that methods were developed</p>
<p>704<br>00:44:17,120 –&gt; 00:44:20,240<br>to understand why certain equations could be solved</p>
<p>705<br>00:44:20,240 –&gt; 00:44:21,760<br>while others couldn’t.</p>
<p>706<br>00:44:27,840 –&gt; 00:44:32,520<br>It’s early morning in Paris on the 29th May 1832.</p>
<p>707<br>00:44:32,520 –&gt; 00:44:37,120<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Evariste Galois</a> is about to fight for his very life.</p>
<p>708<br>00:44:37,120 –&gt; 00:44:40,680<br>It is the reign of the reactionary Bourbon King, Charles X,</p>
<p>709<br>00:44:40,680 –&gt; 00:44:43,960<br>and Galois, like many angry young men in Paris then,</p>
<p>710<br>00:44:43,960 –&gt; 00:44:46,680<br>is a republican revolutionary.</p>
<p>711<br>00:44:46,680 –&gt; 00:44:52,000<br>Unlike the rest of his comrades though, he has another passion - mathematics.</p>
<p>712<br>00:44:53,560 –&gt; 00:44:56,480<br>He had just spent four months in jail.</p>
<p>713<br>00:44:56,480 –&gt; 00:45:00,160<br>Then, in a mysterious saga of unrequited love,</p>
<p>714<br>00:45:00,160 –&gt; 00:45:02,280<br>he is challenged to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel">duel</a>.</p>
<p>715<br>00:45:02,280 –&gt; 00:45:04,280<br>He’d been up the whole previous night</p>
<p>716<br>00:45:04,280 –&gt; 00:45:07,360<br>refining a new language for mathematics he’d developed.</p>
<p>717<br>00:45:07,360 –&gt; 00:45:14,160<br>Galois believed that mathematics shouldn’t be the study of number and shape, but the study of structure.</p>
<p>718<br>00:45:14,160 –&gt; 00:45:17,240<br>Perhaps he was still pre-occupied with his maths.</p>
<p>719<br>00:45:17,240 –&gt; 00:45:18,800<br>GUNSHOT</p>
<p>720<br>00:45:18,800 –&gt; 00:45:21,680<br>There was only one shot fired that morning.</p>
<p>721<br>00:45:21,680 –&gt; 00:45:27,280<br>Galois died the next day, just 20 years old.</p>
<p>722<br>00:45:27,280 –&gt; 00:45:30,320<br>It was one of mathematics greatest losses.</p>
<p>723<br>00:45:30,320 –&gt; 00:45:33,080<br>Only by the beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p>724<br>00:45:33,080 –&gt; 00:45:37,640<br>would Galois be fully appreciated and his ideas fully realised.</p>
<p>725<br>00:45:42,400 –&gt; 00:45:46,520<br>Galois had discovered new techniques to be able to tell</p>
<p>726<br>00:45:46,520 –&gt; 00:45:49,920<br>whether certain equations could have solutions or not.</p>
<p>727<br>00:45:49,920 –&gt; 00:45:54,000<br>The symmetry of certain geometric objects seemed to be the key.</p>
<p>728<br>00:45:54,000 –&gt; 00:45:58,520<br>His idea of using geometry to analyse equations</p>
<p>729<br>00:45:58,520 –&gt; 00:46:03,880<br>would be picked up in the 1920s by another Parisian mathematician, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a>.</p>
<p>730<br>00:46:03,880 –&gt; 00:46:09,520<br>I was very much interested and so far as school was concerned</p>
<p>731<br>00:46:09,520 –&gt; 00:46:13,720<br>quite successful in all possible branches.</p>
<p>732<br>00:46:13,720 –&gt; 00:46:17,480<br>And he was. After studying in Germany as well as France,</p>
<p>733<br>00:46:17,480 –&gt; 00:46:21,000<br>Andre settled down at this apartment in Paris</p>
<p>734<br>00:46:21,000 –&gt; 00:46:25,760<br>which he shared with his more-famous sister, the writer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a>.</p>
<p>735<br>00:46:25,760 –&gt; 00:46:31,040<br>But when the Second World War broke out, he found himself in very different circumstances.</p>
<p>736<br>00:46:31,040 –&gt; 00:46:37,040<br>He dodged the draft by fleeing to Finland where he was almost executed for being a Russian spy.</p>
<p>737<br>00:46:37,040 –&gt; 00:46:42,720<br>On his return to France he was put in prison in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen">Rouen</a> to await trial for desertion.</p>
<p>738<br>00:46:42,720 –&gt; 00:46:45,320<br>At the trial, the judge gave him a choice.</p>
<p>739<br>00:46:45,320 –&gt; 00:46:49,120<br>Five more years in prison or serve in a combat unit.</p>
<p>740<br>00:46:49,120 –&gt; 00:46:52,240<br>He chose to join the French army, a lucky choice</p>
<p>741<br>00:46:52,240 –&gt; 00:46:56,120<br>because just before the Germans invaded a few months later,</p>
<p>742<br>00:46:56,120 –&gt; 00:46:58,280<br>all the prisoners were killed.</p>
<p>743<br>00:46:58,280 –&gt; 00:47:05,400<br>Weil only spent a few months in prison, but this time was crucial for his mathematics.</p>
<p>744<br>00:47:05,400 –&gt; 00:47:11,000<br>Because here he built on the ideas of Galois and first developed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry">algebraic geometry</a></p>
<p>745<br>00:47:11,000 –&gt; 00:47:15,720<br>a whole new language for understanding solutions to equations.</p>
<p>746<br>00:47:15,720 –&gt; 00:47:18,720<br>Galois had shown how new mathematical structures</p>
<p>747<br>00:47:18,720 –&gt; 00:47:22,600<br>can be used to reveal the secrets behind equations.</p>
<p>748<br>00:47:22,600 –&gt; 00:47:24,640<br>Weil’s work led him to theorems</p>
<p>749<br>00:47:24,640 –&gt; 00:47:28,800<br>that connected <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number theory</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">algebra</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry">geometry</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a></p>
<p>750<br>00:47:28,800 –&gt; 00:47:33,720<br>and are one of the greatest achievements of modern mathematics.</p>
<p>751<br>00:47:33,720 –&gt; 00:47:36,760<br>Without Andre Weil, we would never have heard</p>
<p>752<br>00:47:36,760 –&gt; 00:47:41,400<br>of the strangest man in the history of maths, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Nicolas Bourbaki</a>.</p>
<p>753<br>00:47:43,720 –&gt; 00:47:50,400<br>There are no photos of Bourbaki in existence but we do know he was born in this cafe in the Latin Quarter</p>
<p>754<br>00:47:50,400 –&gt; 00:47:54,520<br>in 1934 when it was a proper cafe, the cafe Capoulade,</p>
<p>755<br>00:47:54,520 –&gt; 00:47:58,000<br>and not the fast food joint it has now become.</p>
<p>756<br>00:47:58,000 –&gt; 00:48:03,200<br>Just down the road, I met up with Bourbaki expert David Aubin.</p>
<p>757<br>00:48:03,200 –&gt; 00:48:06,400<br>When I was a graduate student I got quite frightened</p>
<p>758<br>00:48:06,400 –&gt; 00:48:08,120<br>when I used to go into the library</p>
<p>759<br>00:48:08,120 –&gt; 00:48:10,960<br>because this guy Bourbaki had written so many books.</p>
<p>760<br>00:48:10,960 –&gt; 00:48:14,400<br>Something like 30 or 40 altogether.</p>
<p>761<br>00:48:14,400 –&gt; 00:48:19,680<br>In analysis, in geometry, in topology, it was all new foundations.</p>
<p>762<br>00:48:19,680 –&gt; 00:48:23,360<br>Virtually everyone studying Maths seriously anywhere in the world</p>
<p>763<br>00:48:23,360 –&gt; 00:48:28,200<br>in the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s would have read Nicolas Bourbaki.</p>
<p>764<br>00:48:28,200 –&gt; 00:48:31,160<br>He applied for membership of the American Maths Society, I heard.</p>
<p>765<br>00:48:31,160 –&gt; 00:48:33,360<br>At which point he was denied membership</p>
<p>766<br>00:48:33,360 –&gt; 00:48:36,320</p>
<ul>
<li>on the grounds that he didn’t exist. </li>
<li>Oh!</li>
</ul>
<p>767<br>00:48:36,320 –&gt; 00:48:38,160<br>The Americans were right.</p>
<p>768<br>00:48:38,160 –&gt; 00:48:41,880<br>Nicolas Bourbaki does not exist at all. And never has.</p>
<p>769<br>00:48:41,880 –&gt; 00:48:46,200<br>Bourbaki is in fact the nom de plume for a group of French mathematicians</p>
<p>770<br>00:48:46,200 –&gt; 00:48:49,880<br>led by Andre Weil who decided to write a coherent account</p>
<p>771<br>00:48:49,880 –&gt; 00:48:52,480<br>of the mathematics of the 20th century.</p>
<p>772<br>00:48:52,480 –&gt; 00:48:57,200<br>Most of the time mathematicians like to have their own names on theorems.</p>
<p>773<br>00:48:57,200 –&gt; 00:48:59,600<br>But for the Bourbaki group,</p>
<p>774<br>00:48:59,600 –&gt; 00:49:03,440<br>the aims of the project overrode any desire for personal glory.</p>
<p>775<br>00:49:03,440 –&gt; 00:49:07,120<br>After the Second World War, the Bourbaki baton was handed down</p>
<p>776<br>00:49:07,120 –&gt; 00:49:10,080<br>to the next generation of French mathematicians.</p>
<p>777<br>00:49:10,080 –&gt; 00:49:15,400<br>And their most brilliant member was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck">Alexandre Grothendieck</a>.</p>
<p>778<br>00:49:15,400 –&gt; 00:49:17,000<br>Here at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_des_Hautes_%C3%89tudes_Scientifiques">IHES</a> in Paris,</p>
<p>779<br>00:49:17,000 –&gt; 00:49:21,520<br>the French equivalent of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study,</p>
<p>780<br>00:49:21,520 –&gt; 00:49:27,160<br>Grothendieck held court at his famous seminars in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>781<br>00:49:29,920 –&gt; 00:49:33,600<br>He had this incredible charisma.</p>
<p>782<br>00:49:33,600 –&gt; 00:49:40,240<br>He had this amazing ability to see a young person and somehow know</p>
<p>783<br>00:49:40,240 –&gt; 00:49:46,280<br>what kind of contribution this person could make to this incredible vision</p>
<p>784<br>00:49:46,280 –&gt; 00:49:48,920<br>he had of how mathematics could be.</p>
<p>785<br>00:49:48,920 –&gt; 00:49:54,520<br>And this vision enabled him to get across some very difficult ideas indeed.</p>
<p>786<br>00:49:54,520 –&gt; 00:49:58,240<br>He says, “Suppose you want to open a walnut.</p>
<p>787<br>00:49:58,240 –&gt; 00:50:02,200<br>“So the standard thing is you take a nutcracker and you just break it open.”</p>
<p>788<br>00:50:02,200 –&gt; 00:50:04,800<br>And he says his approach is more like,</p>
<p>789<br>00:50:04,800 –&gt; 00:50:08,120<br>you take this walnut and you put it out in the snow</p>
<p>790<br>00:50:08,120 –&gt; 00:50:10,160<br>and you leave it there for a few months</p>
<p>791<br>00:50:10,160 –&gt; 00:50:13,760<br>and then when you come back to it, it just opens.</p>
<p>792<br>00:50:13,760 –&gt; 00:50:15,760<br>Grothendieck is a Structuralist.</p>
<p>793<br>00:50:15,760 –&gt; 00:50:19,720<br>What he’s interested in are the hidden structures</p>
<p>794<br>00:50:19,720 –&gt; 00:50:22,120<br>underneath all mathematics.</p>
<p>795<br>00:50:22,120 –&gt; 00:50:27,560<br>Only when you get down to the very basic architecture and think in very general terms</p>
<p>796<br>00:50:27,560 –&gt; 00:50:31,160<br>will the patterns in mathematics become clear.</p>
<p>797<br>00:50:31,160 –&gt; 00:50:37,120<br>Grothendieck produced a new powerful language to see structures in a new way.</p>
<p>798<br>00:50:37,120 –&gt; 00:50:39,720<br>It was like living in a world of black and white</p>
<p>799<br>00:50:39,720 –&gt; 00:50:42,960<br>and suddenly having the language to see the world in colour.</p>
<p>800<br>00:50:42,960 –&gt; 00:50:46,640<br>It’s a language that mathematicians have been using ever since</p>
<p>801<br>00:50:46,640 –&gt; 00:50:51,640<br>to solve problems in number theory, geometry, even fundamental physics.</p>
<p>802<br>00:50:53,160 –&gt; 00:50:56,440<br>But in the late 1960s, Grothendieck decided</p>
<p>803<br>00:50:56,440 –&gt; 00:51:01,640<br>to turn his back on mathematics after he discovered politics.</p>
<p>804<br>00:51:01,640 –&gt; 00:51:06,320<br>He believed that the threat of nuclear war and the questions</p>
<p>805<br>00:51:06,320 –&gt; 00:51:12,440<br>of nuclear disarmament were more important than mathematics</p>
<p>806<br>00:51:12,440 –&gt; 00:51:17,480<br>and that people who continue to do mathematics</p>
<p>807<br>00:51:17,480 –&gt; 00:51:21,240<br>rather than confront this threat of nuclear war</p>
<p>808<br>00:51:21,240 –&gt; 00:51:22,920<br>were doing harm in the world.</p>
<p>809<br>00:51:26,440 –&gt; 00:51:29,040<br>Grothendieck decided to leave Paris</p>
<p>810<br>00:51:29,040 –&gt; 00:51:32,040<br>and move back to the south of France where he grew up.</p>
<p>811<br>00:51:32,040 –&gt; 00:51:36,680<br>Bursts of radical politics followed and then a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>812<br>00:51:36,680 –&gt; 00:51:40,720<br>He moved to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> and became a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recluse">recluse</a>.</p>
<p>813<br>00:51:40,720 –&gt; 00:51:45,600<br>He’s now lost all contact with his old friends and mathematical colleagues.</p>
<p>814<br>00:51:46,600 –&gt; 00:51:51,040<br>Nevertheless, the legacy of his achievements means that Grothendieck stands</p>
<p>815<br>00:51:51,040 –&gt; 00:51:57,440<br>alongside Cantor, Godel and Hilbert as someone who has transformed the mathematical landscape.</p>
<p>816<br>00:51:59,200 –&gt; 00:52:03,800<br>He changed the whole subject in a really fundamental way. It will never go back.</p>
<p>817<br>00:52:03,800 –&gt; 00:52:08,800<br>Certainly, he’s THE dominant figure of the 20th century.</p>
<p>818<br>00:52:16,200 –&gt; 00:52:18,280<br>I’ve come back to England, though,</p>
<p>819<br>00:52:18,280 –&gt; 00:52:22,440<br>thinking again about another seminal figure of the 20th century.</p>
<p>820<br>00:52:22,440 –&gt; 00:52:26,640<br>The person that started it all off, David Hilbert.</p>
<p>821<br>00:52:26,640 –&gt; 00:52:32,400<br>Of the 23 problems Hilbert set mathematicians in the year 1900,</p>
<p>822<br>00:52:32,400 –&gt; 00:52:34,880<br>most have now been solved.</p>
<p>823<br>00:52:34,880 –&gt; 00:52:37,160<br>However there is one great exception.</p>
<p>824<br>00:52:37,160 –&gt; 00:52:40,360<br>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>, the eighth on Hilbert’s list.</p>
<p>825<br>00:52:40,360 –&gt; 00:52:43,160<br>That is still the holy grail of mathematics.</p>
<p>826<br>00:52:44,960 –&gt; 00:52:50,200<br>Hilbert’s lecture inspired a generation to pursue their mathematical dreams.</p>
<p>827<br>00:52:50,200 –&gt; 00:52:55,120<br>This morning, in the town where I grew up, I hope to inspire another generation.</p>
<p>828<br>00:52:55,120 –&gt; 00:52:57,280<br>CHEERING AND APPLAUSE</p>
<p>829<br>00:53:01,680 –&gt; 00:53:04,120<br>Thank you. Hello. My name’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a></p>
<p>830<br>00:53:04,120 –&gt; 00:53:05,960<br>and I’m a Professor of Mathematics</p>
<p>831<br>00:53:05,960 –&gt; 00:53:08,120<br>up the road at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</a>.</p>
<p>832<br>00:53:08,120 –&gt; 00:53:10,320<br>It was actually in this school here,</p>
<p>833<br>00:53:10,320 –&gt; 00:53:14,520<br>in fact this classroom is where I discovered my love for mathematics.</p>
<p>834<br>00:53:14,520 –&gt; 00:53:17,120<br>‘This love of mathematics that I first acquired</p>
<p>835<br>00:53:17,120 –&gt; 00:53:20,400<br>‘here in my old comprehensive school still drives me now.</p>
<p>836<br>00:53:20,400 –&gt; 00:53:22,280<br>‘It’s a love of solving problems.</p>
<p>837<br>00:53:22,280 –&gt; 00:53:25,680<br>‘There are so many problems I could tell them about,</p>
<p>838<br>00:53:25,680 –&gt; 00:53:27,720<br>‘but I’ve chosen my favourite.’</p>
<p>839<br>00:53:27,720 –&gt; 00:53:30,840<br>I think that a mathematician is a pattern searcher</p>
<p>840<br>00:53:30,840 –&gt; 00:53:33,960<br>and that’s really what mathematicians try and do.</p>
<p>841<br>00:53:33,960 –&gt; 00:53:37,080<br>We try and understand the patterns and the structure</p>
<p>842<br>00:53:37,080 –&gt; 00:53:40,440<br>and the logic to explain the way the world around us works.</p>
<p>843<br>00:53:40,440 –&gt; 00:53:43,480<br>And this is really at the heart of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>844<br>00:53:43,480 –&gt; 00:53:48,360<br>The task is - is there any pattern in these numbers which can help me say</p>
<p>845<br>00:53:48,360 –&gt; 00:53:50,440<br>where the next number will be?</p>
<p>846<br>00:53:50,440 –&gt; 00:53:52,760<br>What’s the next one after 31? How can I tell?</p>
<p>847<br>00:53:52,760 –&gt; 00:53:55,760<br>‘These numbers are, of course, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a> -</p>
<p>848<br>00:53:55,760 –&gt; 00:53:58,200<br>‘the building blocks of mathematics.’</p>
<p>849<br>00:53:58,200 –&gt; 00:54:01,520<br>‘The Riemann hypothesis, a conjecture about the distribution</p>
<p>850<br>00:54:01,520 –&gt; 00:54:04,720<br>‘of the primes, goes to the very heart of our subject.’</p>
<p>851<br>00:54:04,720 –&gt; 00:54:07,560<br>Why on earth is anybody interested in these primes?</p>
<p>852<br>00:54:07,560 –&gt; 00:54:11,040<br>Why is the army interested in primes, why are spies interested?</p>
<p>853<br>00:54:11,040 –&gt; 00:54:14,800</p>
<ul>
<li>Isn’t it to encrypt stuff?</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>854<br>00:54:14,800 –&gt; 00:54:18,280<br>I study this stuff cos I think it’s all really beautiful and elegant</p>
<p>855<br>00:54:18,280 –&gt; 00:54:20,200<br>but actually, there’s a lot of people</p>
<p>856<br>00:54:20,200 –&gt; 00:54:24,440<br>who are interested in these numbers because of their very practical use.</p>
<p>857<br>00:54:24,440 –&gt; 00:54:28,720<br>‘The bizarre thing is that the more abstract and difficult mathematics becomes,</p>
<p>858<br>00:54:28,720 –&gt; 00:54:32,480<br>‘the more it seems to have applications in the real world.</p>
<p>859<br>00:54:32,480 –&gt; 00:54:36,560<br>‘Mathematics now pervades every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>860<br>00:54:36,560 –&gt; 00:54:41,560<br>‘Every time we switch on the television, plug in a computer, pay with a credit card.</p>
<p>861<br>00:54:41,560 –&gt; 00:54:46,160<br>‘There’s now a million dollars for anyone who can solve the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>862<br>00:54:46,160 –&gt; 00:54:48,600<br>‘But there’s more at stake than that.’</p>
<p>863<br>00:54:48,600 –&gt; 00:54:51,800<br>Anybody who proves this theorem will be remembered forever.</p>
<p>864<br>00:54:51,800 –&gt; 00:54:55,640<br>They’ll be on that board ahead of any of those other mathematicians.</p>
<p>865<br>00:54:55,640 –&gt; 00:54:59,600<br>‘That’s because the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a> is a corner-stone of maths.</p>
<p>866<br>00:54:59,600 –&gt; 00:55:02,800<br>‘Thousands of theorems depend on it being true.</p>
<p>867<br>00:55:02,800 –&gt; 00:55:06,000<br>‘Very few mathematicians think that it isn’t true.</p>
<p>868<br>00:55:06,000 –&gt; 00:55:10,640<br>‘But mathematics is about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof">proof</a> and until we can prove it</p>
<p>869<br>00:55:10,640 –&gt; 00:55:12,840<br>‘there will still be doubt.’</p>
<p>870<br>00:55:12,840 –&gt; 00:55:17,160<br>Maths has grown out of this passion to get rid of doubt.</p>
<p>871<br>00:55:17,160 –&gt; 00:55:20,760<br>This is what I have learned in my journey through the history of mathematics.</p>
<p>872<br>00:55:20,760 –&gt; 00:55:25,080<br>Mathematicians like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">al-Khwarizmi</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Gauss</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck">Grothendieck</a></p>
<p>873<br>00:55:25,080 –&gt; 00:55:30,520<br>were driven to understand the precise way numbers and space work.</p>
<p>874<br>00:55:30,520 –&gt; 00:55:33,200<br>Maths in action, that one.</p>
<p>875<br>00:55:33,200 –&gt; 00:55:35,440<br>It’s beautiful. Really nice.</p>
<p>876<br>00:55:35,440 –&gt; 00:55:39,200<br>Using the language of mathematics, they have told us stories</p>
<p>877<br>00:55:39,200 –&gt; 00:55:43,760<br>that remain as true today as they were when they were first told.</p>
<p>878<br>00:55:43,760 –&gt; 00:55:48,760<br>In the Mediterranean, I discovered the origins of geometry.</p>
<p>879<br>00:55:48,760 –&gt; 00:55:51,840<br>Mathematicians and philosophers flocked to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</a></p>
<p>880<br>00:55:51,840 –&gt; 00:55:55,240<br>driven by a thirst for knowledge and the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>881<br>00:55:55,240 –&gt; 00:55:59,080<br>In India, I learned about another discovery</p>
<p>882<br>00:55:59,080 –&gt; 00:56:02,880<br>that it would be impossible to imagine modern life without.</p>
<p>883<br>00:56:02,880 –&gt; 00:56:07,240<br>So here we are in one of the true holy sites of the mathematical world.</p>
<p>884<br>00:56:07,240 –&gt; 00:56:10,080<br>Up here are some numbers,</p>
<p>885<br>00:56:10,080 –&gt; 00:56:12,680<br>and here’s the new number.</p>
<p>886<br>00:56:12,680 –&gt; 00:56:14,320<br>Its zero.</p>
<p>887<br>00:56:14,320 –&gt; 00:56:19,600<br>In the Middle East, I was amazed at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">al-Khwarizmi</a>‘s invention of algebra.</p>
<p>888<br>00:56:19,600 –&gt; 00:56:22,480<br>He developed systematic ways to analyse problems</p>
<p>889<br>00:56:22,480 –&gt; 00:56:26,160<br>so that the solutions would work whatever numbers you took.</p>
<p>890<br>00:56:26,160 –&gt; 00:56:28,080<br>In the Golden Age of Mathematics,</p>
<p>891<br>00:56:28,080 –&gt; 00:56:31,600<br>in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, I found how maths</p>
<p>892<br>00:56:31,600 –&gt; 00:56:35,760<br>discovered new ways for analysing bodies in motion and new geometries</p>
<p>893<br>00:56:35,760 –&gt; 00:56:40,520<br>that helped us understand the very strange shape of space.</p>
<p>894<br>00:56:40,520 –&gt; 00:56:43,840<br>It is with Riemann’s work that we finally have</p>
<p>895<br>00:56:43,840 –&gt; 00:56:49,280<br>the mathematical glasses to be able to explore such worlds of the mind.</p>
<p>896<br>00:56:49,280 –&gt; 00:56:53,480<br>And now my journey into the abstract world of 20th-century mathematics</p>
<p>897<br>00:56:53,480 –&gt; 00:56:56,600<br>has revealed that maths is the true language</p>
<p>898<br>00:56:56,600 –&gt; 00:56:58,800<br>the universe is written in,</p>
<p>899<br>00:56:58,800 –&gt; 00:57:02,120<br>the key to understanding the world around us.</p>
<p>900<br>00:57:02,120 –&gt; 00:57:05,840<br>Mathematicians aren’t motivated by money and material gain</p>
<p>901<br>00:57:05,840 –&gt; 00:57:09,160<br>or even by practical applications of their work.</p>
<p>902<br>00:57:09,160 –&gt; 00:57:13,400<br>For us, it is the glory of solving one of the great unsolved problems</p>

<p>904<br>00:57:18,560 –&gt; 00:57:21,920<br>Hilbert was right. It’s the unsolved problems of mathematics</p>
<p>905<br>00:57:21,920 –&gt; 00:57:23,720<br>that make it a living subject,</p>
<p>906<br>00:57:23,720 –&gt; 00:57:27,160<br>which obsess each new generation of mathematicians.</p>
