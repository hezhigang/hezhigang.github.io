<hr>
<p>1<br>00:00:23,920 –&gt; 00:00:27,000<br>I’m walking in the mountains of the moon.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:29,080 –&gt; 00:00:33,640<br>I’m on the trail of the Renaissance artist, Piero della Francesca,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:33,640 –&gt; 00:00:38,080<br>so I’ve come to the town in northern Italy which Piero made his own.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:38,080 –&gt; 00:00:41,240<br>There it is, Urbino.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:41,240 –&gt; 00:00:45,040<br>I’ve come here to see some of Piero’s finest works,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:45,040 –&gt; 00:00:50,320<br>masterpieces of art, but also masterpieces of mathematics.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:52,080 –&gt; 00:00:55,520<br>The artists and architects of the early Renaissance brought back</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:55,520 –&gt; 00:01:00,200<br>the use of perspective, a technique that had been lost for 1,000 years,</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:00,200 –&gt; 00:01:03,120<br>but using it properly turned out to be a lot</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:03,120 –&gt; 00:01:05,160<br>more difficult than they’d imagined.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:05,160 –&gt; 00:01:10,640<br>Piero was the first major painter to fully understand perspective.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:10,640 –&gt; 00:01:15,720<br>That’s because he was a mathematician as well as an artist.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:15,720 –&gt; 00:01:17,880<br>I came here to see his masterpiece,</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:17,880 –&gt; 00:01:21,440<br>The Flagellation of Christ, but there was a problem.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:21,440 –&gt; 00:01:24,000<br>I’ve just been to see The Flagellation, and it’s an</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:24,000 –&gt; 00:01:27,320<br>absolutely stunning picture, but unfortunately, for various</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:27,320 –&gt; 00:01:30,680<br>kind of Italian reasons, we’re not allowed to go and film in there.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:30,680 –&gt; 00:01:34,160<br>But this is a maths programme, after all, and not an arts programme,</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:34,160 –&gt; 00:01:38,440<br>so I’ve used a bit of mathematics to bring this picture alive.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:38,440 –&gt; 00:01:43,840<br>We can’t go to the picture, but we can make the picture come to us.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,840 –&gt; 00:01:46,080<br>The problem of perspective is how</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:46,080 –&gt; 00:01:51,160<br>to represent the three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional canvas.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:51,160 –&gt; 00:01:54,600<br>To give a sense of depth, a sense of the third dimension,</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:54,600 –&gt; 00:01:57,720<br>Piero used mathematics.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:57,720 –&gt; 00:02:00,440<br>How big is he going to paint Christ,</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:00,440 –&gt; 00:02:03,400<br>if this group of men here were a certain distance away</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:03,400 –&gt; 00:02:05,520<br>from these men in the foreground?</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:07,040 –&gt; 00:02:11,440<br>Get it wrong and the illusion of perspective is shattered.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:11,440 –&gt; 00:02:14,600<br>It’s far from obvious how a three-dimensional world</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:14,600 –&gt; 00:02:19,160<br>can be accurately represented on a two-dimensional surface.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:19,160 –&gt; 00:02:23,000<br>Look at how the parallel lines in the three-dimensional world</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:23,000 –&gt; 00:02:26,800<br>are no longer parallel in the two-dimensional canvas, but meet</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:26,800 –&gt; 00:02:28,680<br>at a vanishing point.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:30,520 –&gt; 00:02:33,600<br>And this is what the tiles in the picture really look like.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:39,200 –&gt; 00:02:41,200<br>What is emerging here is a new</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:41,200 –&gt; 00:02:45,320<br>mathematical language which allows us to map one thing into another.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:45,320 –&gt; 00:02:49,120<br>The power of perspective unleashed a new way to see the world,</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:49,120 –&gt; 00:02:53,280<br>a perspective that would cause a mathematical revolution.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:55,400 –&gt; 00:02:59,640<br>Piero’s work was the beginning of a new way to understand geometry,</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:59,640 –&gt; 00:03:02,080<br>but it would take another 200 years</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:02,080 –&gt; 00:03:05,800<br>before other mathematicians would continue where he left off.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:13,840 –&gt; 00:03:16,440<br>Our journey has come north.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:16,440 –&gt; 00:03:19,480<br>By the 17th century, Europe had taken over</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:19,480 –&gt; 00:03:23,960<br>from the Middle East as the world’s powerhouse of mathematical ideas.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:23,960 –&gt; 00:03:26,000<br>Great strides had been made in the geometry</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:26,000 –&gt; 00:03:27,640<br>of objects fixed in time and space.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:27,640 –&gt; 00:03:30,800<br>In France, Germany, Holland and Britain,</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:30,800 –&gt; 00:03:35,320<br>the race was now on to understand the mathematics of objects in motion</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:35,320 –&gt; 00:03:38,600<br>and the pursuit of this new mathematics started here in this</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:38,600 –&gt; 00:03:42,240<br>village in the centre of France.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:42,240 –&gt; 00:03:45,720<br>Only the French would name a village after a mathematician.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:45,720 –&gt; 00:03:47,400<br>Imagine in England a town called</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:47,400 –&gt; 00:03:50,800<br>Newton or Ball or Cayley. I don’t think so!</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:50,800 –&gt; 00:03:54,880<br>But in France, they really value their mathematicians.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:54,880 –&gt; 00:03:57,400<br>This is the village of Descartes in the Loire Valley.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:57,400 –&gt; 00:04:00,080<br>It was renamed after the famous philosopher</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:00,080 –&gt; 00:04:02,840<br>and mathematician 200 years ago.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:02,840 –&gt; 00:04:07,920<br>Descartes himself was born here in 1596, a sickly child who lost</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:07,920 –&gt; 00:04:11,120<br>his mother when very young, so he was allowed to stay in bed every</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:11,120 –&gt; 00:04:18,000<br>morning until 11.00am, a practice he tried to continue all his life.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:18,000 –&gt; 00:04:20,960<br>To do mathematics, sometimes you just need to remove</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:20,960 –&gt; 00:04:25,520<br>all distractions, to float off into a world of shapes and patterns.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:25,520 –&gt; 00:04:28,600<br>Descartes thought that the bed was the best place to achieve</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:28,600 –&gt; 00:04:30,280<br>this meditative state.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:30,280 –&gt; 00:04:32,000<br>I think I know what he means.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:36,800 –&gt; 00:04:39,600<br>The house where Descartes undertook his bedtime meditations</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:39,600 –&gt; 00:04:43,360<br>is now a museum dedicated to all things Cartesian.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:43,360 –&gt; 00:04:46,760<br>Come with me.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:46,760 –&gt; 00:04:50,920<br>Its exhibition pieces arranged, by curator Sylvie Garnier, show how</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:50,920 –&gt; 00:04:57,040<br>his philosophical, scientific and mathematical ideas all fit together.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:57,040 –&gt; 00:04:58,800<br>It also features less familiar aspects</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:58,800 –&gt; 00:05:00,520<br>of Descartes’ life and career.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:00,520 –&gt; 00:05:03,760<br>So he decided to be a soldier…in the army,</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:05,280 –&gt; 00:05:08,600<br>in the Protestant Army</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:08,600 –&gt; 00:05:14,760<br>and too in the Catholic Army, not a problem for him</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:14,760 –&gt; 00:05:17,760<br>because no patriotism.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:17,760 –&gt; 00:05:20,000<br>Sylvie is putting it very nicely,</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:20,000 –&gt; 00:05:23,480<br>but Descartes was in fact a mercenary.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:23,480 –&gt; 00:05:26,400<br>He fought for the German Protestants, the French Catholics</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:26,400 –&gt; 00:05:29,000<br>and anyone else who would pay him.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:29,000 –&gt; 00:05:34,480<br>Very early one autumn morning in 1628, he was in the Bavarian Army</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:34,480 –&gt; 00:05:37,040<br>camped out on a cold river bank.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:37,040 –&gt; 00:05:40,800<br>Inspiration very often strikes in very strange places.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:40,800 –&gt; 00:05:44,000<br>The story is told how Descartes couldn’t sleep one night,</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:44,000 –&gt; 00:05:46,280<br>maybe because he was getting up so late</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:46,280 –&gt; 00:05:48,920<br>or perhaps he was celebrating St Martin’s Eve</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:48,920 –&gt; 00:05:50,480<br>and had just drunk too much.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:50,480 –&gt; 00:05:52,760<br>Problems were tumbling around in his mind.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:52,760 –&gt; 00:05:55,840<br>He was thinking about his favourite subject, philosophy.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:55,840 –&gt; 00:05:57,760<br>He was finding it very frustrating.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:57,760 –&gt; 00:06:01,640<br>How can you actually know anything at all?!</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:01,640 –&gt; 00:06:04,120<br>Then he slips into a dream…</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:06,400 –&gt; 00:06:10,400<br>and in the dream he understood that the key was to build philosophy</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:10,400 –&gt; 00:06:14,120<br>on the indisputable facts of mathematics.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:14,120 –&gt; 00:06:19,280<br>Numbers, he realised, could brush away the cobwebs of uncertainty.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:19,280 –&gt; 00:06:23,280<br>He wanted to publish all his radical ideas, but he was worried how they’d</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:23,280 –&gt; 00:06:28,440<br>be received in Catholic France, so he packed his bags and left.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:31,480 –&gt; 00:06:34,400<br>Descartes found a home here in Holland.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:34,400 –&gt; 00:06:37,680<br>He’d been one of the champions of the new scientific revolution</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:37,680 –&gt; 00:06:41,320<br>which rejected the dominant view that the sun went around the earth,</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:41,320 –&gt; 00:06:44,560<br>an opinion that got scientists like Galileo</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:44,560 –&gt; 00:06:47,000<br>into deep trouble with the Vatican.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:47,000 –&gt; 00:06:50,560<br>Descartes reckoned that here amongst the Protestant Dutch</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:50,560 –&gt; 00:06:53,040<br>he would be safe, especially</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:53,040 –&gt; 00:06:55,600<br>at the old university town of Leiden</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:55,600 –&gt; 00:06:58,360<br>where they valued maths and science.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:58,360 –&gt; 00:07:00,320<br>I’ve come to Leiden too.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:00,320 –&gt; 00:07:02,600<br>Unfortunately, I’m late!</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:02,600 –&gt; 00:07:05,120<br>Hello. Yeah, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:05,120 –&gt; 00:07:09,240<br>I got a puncture. It took me a bit of time, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:09,240 –&gt; 00:07:13,200<br>Henk Bos is one of Europe’s most eminent Cartesian scholars.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:13,200 –&gt; 00:07:16,680<br>He’s not surprised the French scholar ended up in Leiden.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:16,680 –&gt; 00:07:20,880<br>He came to talk with people and some people were open to his ideas.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:20,880 –&gt; 00:07:24,120<br>This was not only mathematic. It was also a mechanics specially.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:24,120 –&gt; 00:07:26,080<br>He merged algebra and geometry.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:26,080 –&gt; 00:07:31,760</p>
<ul>
<li>Right.</li>
<li>So you could have formulas and figures and go back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>117<br>00:07:31,760 –&gt; 00:07:36,040</p>
<ul>
<li>So a sort of dictionary between the two?</li>
<li>Yeah, yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>118<br>00:07:39,320 –&gt; 00:07:41,360<br>This dictionary, which was finally published here in Holland in 1637,</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:41,360 –&gt; 00:07:42,960<br>included mainly controversial</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:42,960 –&gt; 00:07:46,400<br>philosophical ideas, but the most radical thoughts</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:46,400 –&gt; 00:07:51,720<br>were in the appendix, a proposal to link algebra and geometry.</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:53,760 –&gt; 00:07:58,040<br>Each point in two dimensions can be described by two numbers,</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:58,040 –&gt; 00:08:02,280<br>one giving the horizontal location, the second number giving the point’s</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:02,280 –&gt; 00:08:04,520<br>vertical location.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:04,520 –&gt; 00:08:08,720<br>As the point moves around a circle, these coordinates change,</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:08,720 –&gt; 00:08:12,600<br>but we can write down an equation that identifies the changing value</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:12,600 –&gt; 00:08:15,160<br>of these numbers at any point in the figure.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:15,160 –&gt; 00:08:18,840<br>Suddenly, geometry has turned into algebra.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:18,840 –&gt; 00:08:20,960<br>Using this transformation</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:20,960 –&gt; 00:08:24,520<br>from geometry into numbers, you could tell, for example,</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:24,520 –&gt; 00:08:27,840<br>if the curve on this bridge was part of a circle or not.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:27,840 –&gt; 00:08:29,760<br>You didn’t need to use your eyes.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:29,760 –&gt; 00:08:33,680<br>Instead, the equations of the curve would reveal its secrets,</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:33,680 –&gt; 00:08:35,880<br>but it wouldn’t stop there.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:35,880 –&gt; 00:08:39,480<br>Descartes had unlocked the possibility of navigating geometries</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:39,480 –&gt; 00:08:43,960<br>of higher dimensions, worlds our eyes will never see but are central</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:43,960 –&gt; 00:08:46,440<br>to modern technology and physics.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:46,440 –&gt; 00:08:50,920<br>There’s no doubt that Descartes was one of the giants of mathematics.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:50,920 –&gt; 00:08:55,120<br>Unfortunately, though, he wasn’t the nicest of men.</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:55,120 –&gt; 00:08:59,080<br>I think he was not an easy person, so…</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:59,080 –&gt; 00:09:04,880<br>And he could be… he was very much concerned about</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:04,880 –&gt; 00:09:07,920<br>his image. He was entirely</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:07,920 –&gt; 00:09:12,400<br>self-convinced that he was right, also when he was wrong and his first</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:12,400 –&gt; 00:09:16,400<br>reaction would be that the other one was stupid that hadn’t understood it.</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:16,400 –&gt; 00:09:19,880<br>Descartes may not have been the most congenial person,</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:19,880 –&gt; 00:09:22,520<br>but there’s no doubt that his insight into the connection</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:22,520 –&gt; 00:09:27,440<br>between algebra and geometry transformed mathematics forever.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:27,440 –&gt; 00:09:31,080<br>For his mathematical revolution to work, though, he needed one other</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:31,080 –&gt; 00:09:32,640<br>vital ingredient.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:32,640 –&gt; 00:09:38,440<br>To find that, I had to say goodbye to Henk and Leiden and go to church.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:38,440 –&gt; 00:09:39,960<br>CHORAL SINGING</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:44,000 –&gt; 00:09:46,960<br>I’m not a believer myself, but there’s little doubt</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:46,960 –&gt; 00:09:49,640<br>that many mathematicians from the time of Descartes</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:49,640 –&gt; 00:09:52,040<br>had strong religious convictions.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:56,280 –&gt; 00:09:58,520<br>Maybe it’s just a coincidence,</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:58,520 –&gt; 00:10:02,320<br>but perhaps it’s because mathematics and religion are both building ideas</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:02,320 –&gt; 00:10:08,240<br>upon an undisputed set of axioms - one plus one equals two. God exists.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:08,240 –&gt; 00:10:11,360<br>I think I know which set of axioms I’ve got my faith in.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:14,440 –&gt; 00:10:16,080<br>In the 17th century,</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:16,080 –&gt; 00:10:19,680<br>there was a Parisian monk who went to the same school as Descartes.</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:19,680 –&gt; 00:10:22,840<br>He loved mathematics as much as he loved God.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:22,840 –&gt; 00:10:27,800<br>Indeed, he saw maths and science as evidence of the existence of God,</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:27,800 –&gt; 00:10:31,520<br>Marin Mersenne was a first-class mathematician.</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:31,520 –&gt; 00:10:34,880<br>One of his discoveries in prime numbers is still named after him.</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:36,400 –&gt; 00:10:41,360<br>But he’s also celebrated for his correspondence.</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:41,360 –&gt; 00:10:44,800<br>From his monastery in Paris, Mersenne acted like some kind of</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:44,800 –&gt; 00:10:49,680<br>17th century internet hub, receiving ideas and then sending them on.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:49,680 –&gt; 00:10:51,480<br>It’s not so different now.</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:51,480 –&gt; 00:10:55,040<br>We sit like mathematical monks thinking about our ideas, then</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:55,040 –&gt; 00:10:59,120<br>sending a message to a colleague and hoping for some reply.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:00,840 –&gt; 00:11:05,120<br>There was a spirit of mathematical communication in 17th century Europe</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:05,120 –&gt; 00:11:08,320<br>which had not been seen since the Greeks.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:08,320 –&gt; 00:11:13,080<br>Mersenne urged people to read Descartes’ new work on geometry.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:13,080 –&gt; 00:11:15,280<br>He also did something just as important.</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:15,280 –&gt; 00:11:20,080<br>He publicised some new findings on the properties of numbers</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:20,080 –&gt; 00:11:23,240<br>by an unknown amateur who would end up rivalling Descartes as the</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:23,240 –&gt; 00:11:26,960<br>greatest mathematician of his time, Pierre de Fermat.</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:32,600 –&gt; 00:11:35,080<br>Here in Beaumont-de-Lomagne</p>
<p>179<br>00:11:35,080 –&gt; 00:11:37,320<br>near Toulouse, residents and visitors have come</p>
<p>180<br>00:11:37,320 –&gt; 00:11:42,720<br>out to celebrate the life and work of the village’s most famous son.</p>
<p>181<br>00:11:42,720 –&gt; 00:11:46,120<br>But I’m not too sure what these gladiators are doing here!</p>
<p>182<br>00:11:46,120 –&gt; 00:11:50,840<br>And the appearance of this camel came as a bit of a surprise too.</p>
<p>183<br>00:11:50,840 –&gt; 00:11:53,160<br>The man himself would have hardly approved of</p>
<p>184<br>00:11:53,160 –&gt; 00:11:57,480<br>the ideas of using fun and games to advance an interest in mathematics.</p>
<p>185<br>00:11:57,480 –&gt; 00:12:01,520<br>Unlike the aristocratic Descartes, Fermat wouldn’t have considered it</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:01,520 –&gt; 00:12:05,160<br>worthless or common to create a festival of mathematics.</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:05,160 –&gt; 00:12:07,960<br>Maths in action, that one.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:07,960 –&gt; 00:12:10,240<br>It’s beautiful, really nice, yeah.</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:10,240 –&gt; 00:12:14,840<br>Fermat’s greatest contribution to mathematics was to virtually invent</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:14,840 –&gt; 00:12:16,520<br>modern number theory.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:16,520 –&gt; 00:12:18,480<br>He devised a wide range of conjectures</p>
<p>192<br>00:12:18,480 –&gt; 00:12:21,880<br>and theorems about numbers including his famous Last Theorem,</p>
<p>193<br>00:12:21,880 –&gt; 00:12:27,760<br>the proof of which would puzzle mathematicians for over 350 years,</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:27,760 –&gt; 00:12:29,360<br>but it’s little help to me now.</p>
<p>195<br>00:12:29,360 –&gt; 00:12:31,240<br>Getting it apart is the easy bit.</p>
<p>196<br>00:12:31,240 –&gt; 00:12:33,880<br>It’s putting it together, isn’t it, that’s the difficult bit.</p>
<p>197<br>00:12:33,880 –&gt; 00:12:36,960<br>How many bits have I got? I’ve got six bits.</p>
<p>198<br>00:12:38,720 –&gt; 00:12:42,040<br>I think what I need to do is put some symmetry into this.</p>
<p>199<br>00:12:42,040 –&gt; 00:12:45,000<br>I’m afraid he’s going to tell me how to do it and I don’t want to see.</p>
<p>200<br>00:12:45,000 –&gt; 00:12:48,200<br>I hate being told how to do a problem. I don’t want to look.</p>
<p>201<br>00:12:48,200 –&gt; 00:12:52,000<br>And he’s laughing at me now because I can’t do it.</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:52,000 –&gt; 00:12:54,440<br>That’s very unfair!</p>
<p>203<br>00:12:54,440 –&gt; 00:12:55,840<br>Here we go.</p>
<p>204<br>00:12:56,880 –&gt; 00:12:59,560<br>Can I put them together?</p>
<p>205<br>00:12:59,560 –&gt; 00:13:01,120<br>I got it!</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:01,120 –&gt; 00:13:03,600<br>Now that’s the buzz of doing mathematics when</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:03,600 –&gt; 00:13:08,320<br>the thing clicks together and suddenly you see the right answer.</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:08,320 –&gt; 00:13:12,760<br>Remarkably, Fermat only tackled mathematics in his spare time.</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:12,760 –&gt; 00:13:15,200<br>By day he was a magistrate.</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:15,200 –&gt; 00:13:19,840<br>Battling with mathematical problems was his hobby and his passion.</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:21,440 –&gt; 00:13:23,040<br>The wonderful thing about mathematics is</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:23,040 –&gt; 00:13:24,600<br>you can do it anywhere.</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:24,600 –&gt; 00:13:26,240<br>You don’t have to have a laboratory.</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:26,240 –&gt; 00:13:28,360<br>You don’t even really need a library.</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:28,360 –&gt; 00:13:31,520<br>Fermat used to do much of his work while sitting at the kitchen table</p>
<p>216<br>00:13:31,520 –&gt; 00:13:35,920<br>or praying in his local church or up here on his roof.</p>
<p>217<br>00:13:35,920 –&gt; 00:13:38,280<br>He may have looked like an amateur,</p>
<p>218<br>00:13:38,280 –&gt; 00:13:41,040<br>but he took his mathematics very seriously indeed.</p>
<p>219<br>00:13:41,040 –&gt; 00:13:44,840<br>Fermat managed to find several new patterns in numbers</p>
<p>220<br>00:13:44,840 –&gt; 00:13:46,680<br>that had defeated mathematicians for centuries.</p>
<p>221<br>00:13:46,680 –&gt; 00:13:50,000<br>One of my favourite theorems of Fermat</p>
<p>222<br>00:13:50,000 –&gt; 00:13:52,400<br>is all to do with prime numbers.</p>
<p>223<br>00:13:52,400 –&gt; 00:13:55,480<br>If you’ve got a prime number which when you divide it by four</p>
<p>224<br>00:13:55,480 –&gt; 00:13:58,200<br>leaves remainder one, then Fermat showed you could</p>
<p>225<br>00:13:58,200 –&gt; 00:14:02,280<br>always rewrite this number as two square numbers added together.</p>
<p>226<br>00:14:02,280 –&gt; 00:14:05,720<br>For example, I’ve got 13 cloves of garlic here,</p>
<p>227<br>00:14:05,720 –&gt; 00:14:09,360<br>a prime number which has remainder one when I divide it by four.</p>
<p>228<br>00:14:09,360 –&gt; 00:14:13,760<br>Fermat proved you can rewrite this number as two square numbers added</p>
<p>229<br>00:14:13,760 –&gt; 00:14:17,800<br>together, so 13 can be rewritten</p>
<p>230<br>00:14:17,800 –&gt; 00:14:22,880<br>as three squared plus two squared, or four plus nine.</p>
<p>231<br>00:14:22,880 –&gt; 00:14:26,680<br>The amazing thing is that Fermat proved this will work however big</p>
<p>232<br>00:14:26,680 –&gt; 00:14:31,200<br>the prime number is. Provided it has remainder one on division by four,</p>
<p>233<br>00:14:31,200 –&gt; 00:14:33,520<br>you can always rewrite that number</p>
<p>234<br>00:14:33,520 –&gt; 00:14:36,400<br>as two square numbers added together.</p>
<p>235<br>00:14:39,600 –&gt; 00:14:42,080<br>Ah, my God!</p>
<p>236<br>00:14:44,240 –&gt; 00:14:47,880<br>What I love about this sort of day is the playfulness of mathematics</p>
<p>237<br>00:14:47,880 –&gt; 00:14:51,680<br>and Fermat certainly enjoyed playing around with numbers. He loved</p>
<p>238<br>00:14:51,680 –&gt; 00:14:55,520<br>looking for patterns in numbers and then the puzzle side of mathematics,</p>
<p>239<br>00:14:55,520 –&gt; 00:14:58,840<br>he wanted to prove that these patterns would be there forever.</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:00,800 –&gt; 00:15:04,640<br>But as well as being the basis for fun and games in the years to come,</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:04,640 –&gt; 00:15:09,200<br>Fermat’s mathematics would have some very serious applications.</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:09,200 –&gt; 00:15:11,120<br>One of his theorems, his Little Theorem, is</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:11,120 –&gt; 00:15:16,040<br>the basis of the codes that protect our credit cards on the internet.</p>
<p>244<br>00:15:16,040 –&gt; 00:15:20,080<br>Technology we now rely on today all comes from the scribblings</p>
<p>245<br>00:15:20,080 –&gt; 00:15:22,520<br>of a 17th-century mathematician.</p>
<p>246<br>00:15:24,520 –&gt; 00:15:28,160<br>But the usefulness of Fermat’s mathematics is nothing compared to</p>
<p>247<br>00:15:28,160 –&gt; 00:15:33,200<br>that of our next great mathematician and he comes not from France at all,</p>
<p>248<br>00:15:33,200 –&gt; 00:15:34,880<br>but from its great rival.</p>
<p>249<br>00:15:38,280 –&gt; 00:15:43,040<br>In the 17th century, Britain was emerging as a world power.</p>
<p>250<br>00:15:43,040 –&gt; 00:15:46,600<br>Its expansion and ambitions required new methods of measurement</p>
<p>251<br>00:15:46,600 –&gt; 00:15:51,960<br>and computation and that gave a great boost to mathematics.</p>
<p>252<br>00:15:51,960 –&gt; 00:15:53,840<br>The university towns of Oxford and Cambridge</p>
<p>253<br>00:15:53,840 –&gt; 00:15:58,720<br>were churning out mathematicians who were in great demand</p>
<p>254<br>00:15:58,720 –&gt; 00:16:02,680<br>and the greatest of them was Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:06,760 –&gt; 00:16:09,360<br>I’m here in Grantham, where Isaac Newton grew up,</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:09,360 –&gt; 00:16:11,240<br>and they’re very proud of him here.</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:11,240 –&gt; 00:16:13,120<br>They have a wonderful statue to him.</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:13,120 –&gt; 00:16:14,680<br>They’ve even got</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:14,680 –&gt; 00:16:18,920<br>the Isaac Newton Shopping Centre, with a nice apple logo up there.</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:18,920 –&gt; 00:16:21,920<br>There’s a school that he went to with a nice blue plaque</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:21,920 –&gt; 00:16:25,480<br>and there’s a museum over here in the Town Hall, although, actually,</p>
<p>262<br>00:16:25,480 –&gt; 00:16:28,480<br>one of the other famous residents here, Margaret Thatcher,</p>
<p>263<br>00:16:28,480 –&gt; 00:16:30,920<br>has got as big a display as Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>264<br>00:16:30,920 –&gt; 00:16:32,600<br>In fact, the Thatcher cups have</p>
<p>265<br>00:16:32,600 –&gt; 00:16:36,640<br>sold out and there’s loads of Newton ones still left,</p>
<p>266<br>00:16:36,640 –&gt; 00:16:41,320<br>so I thought I would support mathematics by buying a Newton cup.</p>
<p>267<br>00:16:41,320 –&gt; 00:16:43,920<br>And Newton’s maths does need support.</p>
<p>268<br>00:16:43,920 –&gt; 00:16:49,360</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton’s very famous here. Do you know what he’s famous for?</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>269<br>00:16:49,360 –&gt; 00:16:53,920</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I don’t.</li>
<li>Discovering gravity. </li>
<li>Gravity?</li>
<li>Gravity, yes.</li>
<li>Gravity?</li>
</ul>
<p>270<br>00:16:53,920 –&gt; 00:16:58,360</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple tree and all that, gravity. </li>
<li>‘That pretty much summed it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>271<br>00:16:58,360 –&gt; 00:17:01,560<br>‘If people know about Newton’s work at all, it is his physics,</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:01,560 –&gt; 00:17:05,160<br>‘his laws of gravity in motion, not his mathematics.’</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:05,160 –&gt; 00:17:07,360</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m in a rush!</li>
<li>You’re in a rush. OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>274<br>00:17:07,360 –&gt; 00:17:10,680<br>Acceleration, you see? One of Newton’s laws!</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:18,200 –&gt; 00:17:20,080<br>Eight miles south of Grantham,</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:20,080 –&gt; 00:17:22,960<br>in the village of Woolsthorpe, where Newton was born,</p>
<p>277<br>00:17:22,960 –&gt; 00:17:26,040<br>I met up with someone who does share my passion for his mathematics.</p>
<p>278<br>00:17:26,040 –&gt; 00:17:28,080<br>This is the house.</p>
<p>279<br>00:17:28,080 –&gt; 00:17:32,120<br>Wow, beautiful. ‘Jackie Stedall is a Newton fan and more than willing</p>
<p>280<br>00:17:32,120 –&gt; 00:17:35,360<br>‘to show me around the house where Newton was brought up.’</p>
<p>281<br>00:17:35,360 –&gt; 00:17:37,360<br>So here is the…</p>
<p>282<br>00:17:37,360 –&gt; 00:17:40,840<br>you might call it the dining room. I’m sure they didn’t call it that,</p>
<p>283<br>00:17:40,840 –&gt; 00:17:43,560<br>but the room where they ate, next to the kitchen.</p>
<p>284<br>00:17:43,560 –&gt; 00:17:45,520<br>Of course, there would have been a huge fire in there.</p>
<p>285<br>00:17:45,520 –&gt; 00:17:48,120<br>Yes! Gosh, I wish it was there now!</p>
<p>286<br>00:17:48,120 –&gt; 00:17:50,640<br>His father was an illiterate farmer,</p>
<p>287<br>00:17:50,640 –&gt; 00:17:53,120<br>but he died shortly before Newton was born.</p>
<p>288<br>00:17:53,120 –&gt; 00:17:57,080<br>Otherwise, the young Isaac’s fate might have been very different.</p>
<p>289<br>00:17:57,080 –&gt; 00:17:59,080<br>And here’s his room.</p>
<p>290<br>00:17:59,080 –&gt; 00:18:01,480<br>Oh, lovely, wow.</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:01,480 –&gt; 00:18:03,760</p>
<ul>
<li>They present it really nicely.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>292<br>00:18:03,760 –&gt; 00:18:07,440</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s got a real feel of going back in time.</li>
<li>It does, yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>293<br>00:18:07,440 –&gt; 00:18:10,440<br>I can see he’s as scruffy as I am. Look at the state of that bed.</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:10,440 –&gt; 00:18:13,480<br>That’s how, I think, I left my bed this morning.</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:13,480 –&gt; 00:18:18,160<br>Newton hated his stepfather, but it was this man who ensured</p>
<p>296<br>00:18:18,160 –&gt; 00:18:21,240<br>he became a mathematician rather than a sheep farmer.</p>
<p>297<br>00:18:21,240 –&gt; 00:18:23,480<br>I don’t think he was particularly remarkable as a child.</p>
<p>298<br>00:18:23,480 –&gt; 00:18:26,800</p>
<ul>
<li>OK.</li>
<li>So there’s hope for all those kids out there.</li>
<li>Yes, yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>299<br>00:18:26,800 –&gt; 00:18:28,400<br>I think he had a sort of average school report.</p>
<p>300<br>00:18:28,400 –&gt; 00:18:32,280<br>He had very few close friends. I don’t feel he’s someone</p>
<p>301<br>00:18:32,280 –&gt; 00:18:33,880<br>I particularly would have wanted to meet,</p>
<p>302<br>00:18:33,880 –&gt; 00:18:37,760<br>but I do love his mathematics. It’s wonderful.</p>
<p>303<br>00:18:37,760 –&gt; 00:18:40,320<br>Newton came back to Lincolnshire from Cambridge</p>
<p>304<br>00:18:40,320 –&gt; 00:18:46,600<br>during the Great Plague of 1665 when he was just 22 years old.</p>
<p>305<br>00:18:46,600 –&gt; 00:18:50,880<br>In two miraculous years here, he developed a new theory of light,</p>
<p>306<br>00:18:50,880 –&gt; 00:18:52,400<br>discovered gravitation</p>
<p>307<br>00:18:52,400 –&gt; 00:18:57,960<br>and scribbled out a revolutionary approach to maths, the calculus.</p>
<p>308<br>00:18:57,960 –&gt; 00:18:59,880<br>It works like this.</p>
<p>309<br>00:18:59,880 –&gt; 00:19:03,920<br>I’m going to accelerate this car from 0 to 60 as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:03,920 –&gt; 00:19:07,520<br>The speedometer is showing me that the speed’s changing all the time,</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:07,520 –&gt; 00:19:09,360<br>but this is only an average speed.</p>
<p>312<br>00:19:09,360 –&gt; 00:19:11,480<br>How can I tell precisely what my speed is</p>
<p>313<br>00:19:11,480 –&gt; 00:19:15,400<br>at any particular instant? Well, here’s how.</p>
<p>314<br>00:19:15,400 –&gt; 00:19:20,320<br>As the car races along the road, we can draw a graph above the road</p>
<p>315<br>00:19:20,320 –&gt; 00:19:23,560<br>where the height above each point in the road records how long it took</p>
<p>316<br>00:19:23,560 –&gt; 00:19:26,400<br>the car to get to that point.</p>
<p>317<br>00:19:26,400 –&gt; 00:19:28,840<br>I can calculate the average speed between</p>
<p>318<br>00:19:28,840 –&gt; 00:19:33,240<br>two points, A and B, on my journey by recording the distance travelled</p>
<p>319<br>00:19:33,240 –&gt; 00:19:37,760<br>and dividing by the time it took to get between these two points,</p>
<p>320<br>00:19:37,760 –&gt; 00:19:42,000<br>but what about the precise speed at the first point, A?</p>
<p>321<br>00:19:43,520 –&gt; 00:19:48,200<br>If I move point B closer and closer to the first point, I take a smaller</p>
<p>322<br>00:19:48,200 –&gt; 00:19:51,440<br>and smaller window of time and the speed gets closer</p>
<p>323<br>00:19:51,440 –&gt; 00:19:55,240<br>and closer to the true value, but eventually, it looks like</p>
<p>324<br>00:19:55,240 –&gt; 00:19:59,320<br>I have to calculate 0 divided by 0.</p>
<p>325<br>00:19:59,320 –&gt; 00:20:03,920<br>The calculus allows us to make sense of this calculation.</p>
<p>326<br>00:20:03,920 –&gt; 00:20:08,320<br>It enables us to work out the exact speed and also the precise distance</p>
<p>327<br>00:20:08,320 –&gt; 00:20:11,280<br>travelled at any moment in time.</p>
<p>328<br>00:20:11,280 –&gt; 00:20:15,080<br>I mean, it does make sense, the things we take for granted so much,</p>
<p>329<br>00:20:15,080 –&gt; 00:20:16,720<br>things like… if I drop this apple…</p>
<p>330<br>00:20:16,720 –&gt; 00:20:18,280<br>Its distance is changing and its</p>
<p>331<br>00:20:18,280 –&gt; 00:20:20,920<br>speed is changing and calculus can deal with all of that.</p>
<p>332<br>00:20:20,920 –&gt; 00:20:22,480<br>Which is quite in contrast to the Greeks.</p>
<p>333<br>00:20:22,480 –&gt; 00:20:25,120<br>It was a very static geometry.</p>
<p>334<br>00:20:25,120 –&gt; 00:20:27,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is.</li>
<li>And here we see…</li>
</ul>
<p>335<br>00:20:27,000 –&gt; 00:20:29,880<br>so the calculus is used by</p>
<p>336<br>00:20:29,880 –&gt; 00:20:33,200<br>every engineer, physicist, because it can describe the moving world.</p>
<p>337<br>00:20:33,200 –&gt; 00:20:36,720<br>Yes, and it’s the only way really you can deal with the mathematics of</p>
<p>338<br>00:20:36,720 –&gt; 00:20:38,480<br>motion or with change.</p>
<p>339<br>00:20:38,480 –&gt; 00:20:40,080<br>There’s a lot of mathematics in this apple!</p>
<p>340<br>00:20:42,360 –&gt; 00:20:46,040<br>Newton’s calculus enables us to really understand</p>
<p>341<br>00:20:46,040 –&gt; 00:20:50,600<br>the changing world, the orbits of planets, the motions of fluids.</p>
<p>342<br>00:20:50,600 –&gt; 00:20:54,200<br>Through the power of the calculus, we have a way of describing, with</p>
<p>343<br>00:20:54,200 –&gt; 00:20:58,840<br>mathematical precision, the complex, ever-changing natural world.</p>
<p>344<br>00:21:04,800 –&gt; 00:21:09,080<br>But it would take 200 years to realise its full potential.</p>
<p>345<br>00:21:09,080 –&gt; 00:21:12,640<br>Newton himself decided not to publish, but just to circulate</p>
<p>346<br>00:21:12,640 –&gt; 00:21:14,960<br>his thoughts among friends.</p>
<p>347<br>00:21:14,960 –&gt; 00:21:17,240<br>His reputation, though, gradually spread.</p>
<p>348<br>00:21:17,240 –&gt; 00:21:21,480<br>He became a professor, an MP, and then Warden of the Royal Mint</p>
<p>349<br>00:21:21,480 –&gt; 00:21:23,640<br>here in the City of London.</p>
<p>350<br>00:21:25,600 –&gt; 00:21:28,760<br>On his regular trips to the Royal Society from the Royal Mint,</p>
<p>351<br>00:21:28,760 –&gt; 00:21:33,120<br>he preferred to think about theology and alchemy rather than mathematics.</p>
<p>352<br>00:21:33,120 –&gt; 00:21:35,440<br>Developing the calculus just got crowded out</p>
<p>353<br>00:21:35,440 –&gt; 00:21:39,720<br>by all his other interests until he heard about a rival…</p>
<p>354<br>00:21:41,800 –&gt; 00:21:46,080<br>a rival who was also a member of the Royal Society and who came up</p>
<p>355<br>00:21:46,080 –&gt; 00:21:48,800<br>with exactly the same idea as him,</p>
<p>356<br>00:21:48,800 –&gt; 00:21:50,960<br>Gottfried Leibniz.</p>
<p>357<br>00:21:50,960 –&gt; 00:21:54,240<br>Every word Leibniz wrote has been preserved and catalogued</p>
<p>358<br>00:21:54,240 –&gt; 00:21:57,800<br>in his hometown of Hanover in northern Germany.</p>
<p>359<br>00:21:57,800 –&gt; 00:22:01,040<br>His actual manuscripts are kept under lock and key,</p>
<p>360<br>00:22:01,040 –&gt; 00:22:04,360<br>particularly the manuscript which shows how Leibniz</p>
<p>361<br>00:22:04,360 –&gt; 00:22:09,720<br>also discovered the miracle of calculus, shortly after Newton.</p>
<p>362<br>00:22:09,720 –&gt; 00:22:11,520<br>What age was he when he wrote…</p>
<p>363<br>00:22:11,520 –&gt; 00:22:16,720<br>He was 29 years old and that’s the time, within two months, he developed</p>
<p>364<br>00:22:16,720 –&gt; 00:22:19,640</p>
<ul>
<li>differential calculus and integral calculus.</li>
<li>In two months?</li>
</ul>
<p>365<br>00:22:19,640 –&gt; 00:22:21,600</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Fast and furious, when it comes, er…</li>
</ul>
<p>366<br>00:22:21,600 –&gt; 00:22:23,240<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>367<br>00:22:23,240 –&gt; 00:22:26,440<br>There is a little scrap of paper over here. What’s that one?</p>
<p>368<br>00:22:26,440 –&gt; 00:22:29,840</p>
<ul>
<li>A letter or…</li>
<li>That’s a small manuscript of Leibniz’s notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>369<br>00:22:32,560 –&gt; 00:22:37,280<br>“Sometimes it happens that in the morning lying in the bed,</p>
<p>370<br>00:22:37,280 –&gt; 00:22:40,960<br>“I have so many ideas that it takes the whole morning and sometimes</p>
<p>371<br>00:22:40,960 –&gt; 00:22:45,760<br>“even longer to note all these ideas and bring them to paper.”</p>
<p>372<br>00:22:45,760 –&gt; 00:22:47,280<br>I suppose, that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>373<br>00:22:47,280 –&gt; 00:22:51,480<br>I suppose that he liked to lie in the bed in the morning.</p>
<p>374<br>00:22:51,480 –&gt; 00:22:53,400</p>
<ul>
<li>A true mathematician.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>375<br>00:22:53,400 –&gt; 00:22:55,680<br>He spends his time thinking in bed.</p>
<p>376<br>00:22:55,680 –&gt; 00:22:58,640<br>I see you’ve got some paintings down here.</p>
<p>377<br>00:22:58,640 –&gt; 00:23:00,280<br>A painting.</p>
<p>378<br>00:23:00,280 –&gt; 00:23:02,360<br>This is what he looked like. Right.</p>
<p>379<br>00:23:03,880 –&gt; 00:23:07,280<br>Even though he didn’t become quite the 17th century celebrity</p>
<p>380<br>00:23:07,280 –&gt; 00:23:10,560<br>that Newton did, it wasn’t such a bad life.</p>
<p>381<br>00:23:10,560 –&gt; 00:23:12,520<br>Leibniz worked for the Royal Family</p>
<p>382<br>00:23:12,520 –&gt; 00:23:16,600<br>of Hanover and travelled around Europe representing their interests.</p>
<p>383<br>00:23:16,600 –&gt; 00:23:19,040<br>This gave him plenty of time to indulge in</p>
<p>384<br>00:23:19,040 –&gt; 00:23:23,400<br>his favourite intellectual pastimes, which were wide, even for the time.</p>
<p>385<br>00:23:23,400 –&gt; 00:23:26,960<br>He devised a plan for reunifying the Protestant and Roman Catholic</p>
<p>386<br>00:23:26,960 –&gt; 00:23:32,000<br>churches, a proposal for France to conquer Egypt and contributions to</p>
<p>387<br>00:23:32,000 –&gt; 00:23:36,280<br>philosophy and logic which are still highly rated today.</p>
<p>388<br>00:23:36,280 –&gt; 00:23:39,880</p>
<ul>
<li>He wrote all these letters?</li>
<li>Yeah. </li>
<li>That’s absolutely extraordinary.</li>
</ul>
<p>389<br>00:23:39,880 –&gt; 00:23:43,080<br>He must have cloned himself. I can’t believe there was just one Leibniz!</p>
<p>390<br>00:23:43,080 –&gt; 00:23:46,040<br>‘But Leibniz was not just man of words.</p>
<p>391<br>00:23:46,040 –&gt; 00:23:47,640<br>‘He was also one of the first people</p>
<p>392<br>00:23:47,640 –&gt; 00:23:49,480<br>‘to invent practical calculating machines</p>
<p>393<br>00:23:49,480 –&gt; 00:23:54,520<br>‘that worked on the binary system, true forerunners of the computer.</p>
<p>394<br>00:23:54,520 –&gt; 00:23:58,680<br>‘300 years later, the engineering department at Leibniz University</p>
<p>395<br>00:23:58,680 –&gt; 00:24:02,880<br>‘in Hanover have put them together following Leibniz’s blueprint.’</p>
<p>396<br>00:24:02,880 –&gt; 00:24:04,760<br>I love all the ball bearings, so these are going to be all</p>
<p>397<br>00:24:04,760 –&gt; 00:24:06,680<br>of our zeros and ones. So a ball bearing is a one.</p>
<p>398<br>00:24:06,680 –&gt; 00:24:10,720<br>Only zero and one. Now we represent a number 127.</p>
<p>399<br>00:24:10,720 –&gt; 00:24:15,960</p>
<ul>
<li>In binary, it means that we have the first seven digits in one.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>400<br>00:24:15,960 –&gt; 00:24:18,880</p>
<ul>
<li>And now I give the number one.</li>
<li>OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>401<br>00:24:18,880 –&gt; 00:24:24,360<br>Now we add 127 plus one - is 128, which is two, power eight.</p>
<p>402<br>00:24:24,360 –&gt; 00:24:28,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, OK. So there’s going to be lots of action.</li>
<li>Would you show this here?</li>
</ul>
<p>403<br>00:24:28,000 –&gt; 00:24:30,480<br>This is the money shot.</p>
<p>404<br>00:24:30,480 –&gt; 00:24:33,560<br>So we’re going to add one. Oops. Here we go. They’re all carrying.</p>
<p>405<br>00:24:33,560 –&gt; 00:24:36,520<br>So this 128 is two power eight.</p>
<p>406<br>00:24:36,520 –&gt; 00:24:42,360<br>Excellent, so 127 in binary is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, which is</p>
<p>407<br>00:24:42,360 –&gt; 00:24:44,320<br>all the ball bearings here.</p>
<p>408<br>00:24:44,320 –&gt; 00:24:46,320<br>To add one it all gets</p>
<p>409<br>00:24:46,320 –&gt; 00:24:50,920<br>carried, this goes to 0, 0, 0, 0, and we have a power of two here.</p>
<p>410<br>00:24:50,920 –&gt; 00:24:53,080<br>So this mechanism gets rid of all the ball bearings that you</p>
<p>411<br>00:24:53,080 –&gt; 00:24:56,680</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t need. It’s like pinball, mathematical pinball.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>412<br>00:24:56,680 –&gt; 00:24:58,200<br>I love this machine!</p>
<p>413<br>00:25:03,680 –&gt; 00:25:08,120<br>After a hard day’s work, Leibniz often came here,</p>
<p>414<br>00:25:08,120 –&gt; 00:25:10,080<br>the famous gardens of Herrenhausen,</p>
<p>415<br>00:25:10,080 –&gt; 00:25:14,800<br>now in the middle of Hanover, but then on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>416<br>00:25:14,800 –&gt; 00:25:17,400<br>There’s something about mathematics and walking.</p>
<p>417<br>00:25:17,400 –&gt; 00:25:21,040<br>I don’t know, you’ve been working at your desk all day, all morning</p>
<p>418<br>00:25:21,040 –&gt; 00:25:22,640<br>on some problem and your head’s all</p>
<p>419<br>00:25:22,640 –&gt; 00:25:25,040<br>fuzzy, and you just need to come and have a walk.</p>
<p>420<br>00:25:25,040 –&gt; 00:25:27,760<br>You let your subconscious mind kind of take over and sometimes</p>
<p>421<br>00:25:27,760 –&gt; 00:25:31,880<br>you get your breakthrough just looking at the trees or whatever.</p>
<p>422<br>00:25:31,880 –&gt; 00:25:35,160<br>I’ve had some of my best ideas whilst walking in my local park,</p>
<p>423<br>00:25:35,160 –&gt; 00:25:39,120<br>so I’m hoping to get a little bit of inspiration here on Leibniz’s</p>
<p>424<br>00:25:39,120 –&gt; 00:25:40,760<br>local stomping ground.</p>
<p>425<br>00:25:44,240 –&gt; 00:25:47,120<br>I didn’t get the chance to purge my mind of mathematical challenges</p>
<p>426<br>00:25:47,120 –&gt; 00:25:49,240<br>because in the years since Leibniz lived here,</p>
<p>427<br>00:25:49,240 –&gt; 00:25:50,440<br>someone has built a maze.</p>
<p>428<br>00:25:50,440 –&gt; 00:25:53,520<br>Well, there is a mathematical formula for getting out of a maze,</p>
<p>429<br>00:25:53,520 –&gt; 00:25:57,200<br>which is if you put your left hand on the side of the maze and just</p>
<p>430<br>00:25:57,200 –&gt; 00:26:00,760<br>keep it there, keep on winding round, you eventually get out.</p>
<p>431<br>00:26:00,760 –&gt; 00:26:03,760<br>That’s the theory, at least. Let’s see whether it works!</p>
<p>432<br>00:26:11,080 –&gt; 00:26:13,600<br>Leibniz had no such distractions.</p>
<p>433<br>00:26:13,600 –&gt; 00:26:17,320<br>Within five years, he’d worked out the details of the calculus,</p>
<p>434<br>00:26:17,320 –&gt; 00:26:19,160<br>seemingly independent from Newton,</p>
<p>435<br>00:26:19,160 –&gt; 00:26:21,680<br>although he knew about Newton’s work,</p>
<p>436<br>00:26:21,680 –&gt; 00:26:26,200<br>but unlike Newton, Leibniz was quite happy to make his work known</p>
<p>437<br>00:26:26,200 –&gt; 00:26:29,440<br>and so mathematicians across Europe heard about the calculus first</p>
<p>438<br>00:26:29,440 –&gt; 00:26:35,680<br>from him and not from Newton, and that’s when all the trouble started.</p>
<p>439<br>00:26:35,680 –&gt; 00:26:39,200<br>Throughout mathematical history, there have been lots of priority</p>
<p>440<br>00:26:39,200 –&gt; 00:26:40,800<br>disputes and arguments.</p>
<p>441<br>00:26:40,800 –&gt; 00:26:43,800<br>It may seem a little bit petty and schoolboyish.</p>
<p>442<br>00:26:43,800 –&gt; 00:26:46,600<br>We really want our name to be on that theorem.</p>
<p>443<br>00:26:46,600 –&gt; 00:26:49,800<br>This is our one chance for a little bit of immortality because that</p>
<p>444<br>00:26:49,800 –&gt; 00:26:54,120<br>theorem’s going to last forever and that’s why we dedicate so much time</p>
<p>445<br>00:26:54,120 –&gt; 00:26:55,920<br>to trying to crack these things.</p>
<p>446<br>00:26:55,920 –&gt; 00:26:57,800<br>Somehow we can’t believe that somebody else</p>
<p>447<br>00:26:57,800 –&gt; 00:27:00,000<br>has got it at the same time as us.</p>
<p>448<br>00:27:00,000 –&gt; 00:27:03,040<br>These are our theorems, our babies, our children and we</p>
<p>449<br>00:27:03,040 –&gt; 00:27:06,000<br>don’t want to share the credit.</p>
<p>450<br>00:27:06,000 –&gt; 00:27:08,440<br>Back in London, Newton certainly didn’t want</p>
<p>451<br>00:27:08,440 –&gt; 00:27:13,040<br>to share credit with Leibniz, who he thought of as a Hanoverian upstart.</p>
<p>452<br>00:27:13,040 –&gt; 00:27:16,160<br>After years of acrimony and accusation, the Royal Society</p>
<p>453<br>00:27:16,160 –&gt; 00:27:21,120<br>in London was asked to adjudicate between the rival claims.</p>
<p>454<br>00:27:21,120 –&gt; 00:27:23,080<br>The Royal Society gave Newton credit</p>
<p>455<br>00:27:23,080 –&gt; 00:27:25,240<br>for the first discovery of the calculus</p>
<p>456<br>00:27:25,240 –&gt; 00:27:28,880<br>and Leibniz credit for the first publication,</p>
<p>457<br>00:27:28,880 –&gt; 00:27:33,400<br>but in their final judgment, they accused Leibniz of plagiarism.</p>
<p>458<br>00:27:33,400 –&gt; 00:27:36,640<br>However, that might have had something to do with the fact that</p>
<p>459<br>00:27:36,640 –&gt; 00:27:41,920<br>the report was written by their President, one Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>460<br>00:27:44,040 –&gt; 00:27:46,440<br>Leibniz was incredibly hurt.</p>
<p>461<br>00:27:46,440 –&gt; 00:27:50,400<br>He admired Newton and never really recovered.</p>
<p>462<br>00:27:50,400 –&gt; 00:27:52,440<br>He died in 1716.</p>
<p>463<br>00:27:52,440 –&gt; 00:27:56,200<br>Newton lived on another 11 years and was buried in the grandeur of</p>
<p>464<br>00:27:56,200 –&gt; 00:27:58,240<br>Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>465<br>00:27:58,240 –&gt; 00:28:00,360<br>Leibniz’s memorial, by contrast,</p>
<p>466<br>00:28:00,360 –&gt; 00:28:02,520<br>is here in this small church in Hanover.</p>
<p>467<br>00:28:02,520 –&gt; 00:28:06,040<br>The irony is that it’s Leibniz’s mathematics which</p>
<p>468<br>00:28:06,040 –&gt; 00:28:08,800<br>eventually triumphs, not Newton’s.</p>
<p>469<br>00:28:11,040 –&gt; 00:28:13,720<br>I’m a big Leibniz fan.</p>
<p>470<br>00:28:13,720 –&gt; 00:28:16,920<br>Quite often revolutions in mathematics are about producing the</p>
<p>471<br>00:28:16,920 –&gt; 00:28:19,680<br>right language to capture a new vision and that’s what</p>
<p>472<br>00:28:19,680 –&gt; 00:28:21,520<br>Leibniz was so good at.</p>
<p>473<br>00:28:21,520 –&gt; 00:28:25,280<br>Leibniz’s notation, his way of writing the calculus,</p>
<p>474<br>00:28:25,280 –&gt; 00:28:27,360<br>captured its true spirit.</p>
<p>475<br>00:28:27,360 –&gt; 00:28:29,960<br>It’s still the one we use in maths today.</p>
<p>476<br>00:28:29,960 –&gt; 00:28:34,320<br>Newton’s notation was, for many mathematicians, clumsy and difficult</p>
<p>477<br>00:28:34,320 –&gt; 00:28:38,600<br>to use and so while British mathematics loses its way a little,</p>
<p>478<br>00:28:38,600 –&gt; 00:28:43,360<br>the story of maths switches to the very heart of Europe, Basel.</p>
<p>479<br>00:28:48,560 –&gt; 00:28:52,280<br>In its heyday in the 18th century, the free city of Basel in</p>
<p>480<br>00:28:52,280 –&gt; 00:28:56,840<br>Switzerland was the commercial hub of the entire Western world.</p>
<p>481<br>00:28:56,840 –&gt; 00:28:59,640<br>Around this maelstrom of trade, there developed a tradition of</p>
<p>482<br>00:28:59,640 –&gt; 00:29:03,520<br>learning, particularly learning which connected with commerce</p>
<p>483<br>00:29:03,520 –&gt; 00:29:06,400<br>and one family summed all this up.</p>
<p>484<br>00:29:06,400 –&gt; 00:29:11,160<br>It’s kind of curious - artists often have children who are artists.</p>
<p>485<br>00:29:11,160 –&gt; 00:29:15,480<br>Musicians, their children are often musicians, but us mathematicians,</p>
<p>486<br>00:29:15,480 –&gt; 00:29:17,680<br>our children don’t tend to be mathematicians.</p>
<p>487<br>00:29:17,680 –&gt; 00:29:19,720<br>I’m not sure why it is.</p>
<p>488<br>00:29:19,720 –&gt; 00:29:23,000<br>At least that’s my view, although others dispute it.</p>
<p>489<br>00:29:23,000 –&gt; 00:29:25,000<br>What no-one disagrees with</p>
<p>490<br>00:29:25,000 –&gt; 00:29:30,080<br>is there is one great dynasty of mathematicians, the Bernoullis.</p>
<p>491<br>00:29:30,080 –&gt; 00:29:33,760<br>In the 18th and 19th centuries they produced half a dozen</p>
<p>492<br>00:29:33,760 –&gt; 00:29:37,040<br>outstanding mathematicians, any of which we would have been</p>
<p>493<br>00:29:37,040 –&gt; 00:29:41,800<br>proud to have had in Britain, and they all came from Basel.</p>
<p>494<br>00:29:41,800 –&gt; 00:29:44,960<br>You might have great minds like Newton and Leibniz who make</p>
<p>495<br>00:29:44,960 –&gt; 00:29:48,440<br>these fundamental breakthroughs, but you also need the disciples</p>
<p>496<br>00:29:48,440 –&gt; 00:29:51,680<br>who take that message, clarify it, realise its implications,</p>
<p>497<br>00:29:51,680 –&gt; 00:29:55,480<br>then spread it wide. The family were originally merchants,</p>
<p>498<br>00:29:55,480 –&gt; 00:29:57,440<br>and this is one of their houses.</p>
<p>499<br>00:29:57,440 –&gt; 00:30:00,360<br>It’s now part of the University of Basel</p>
<p>500<br>00:30:00,360 –&gt; 00:30:03,440<br>and it’s been completely refurbished, apart from one room,</p>
<p>501<br>00:30:03,440 –&gt; 00:30:07,360<br>which has been kept very much as the family would have used it.</p>
<p>502<br>00:30:07,360 –&gt; 00:30:09,720<br>Dr Fritz Nagel, keeper of the Bernoulli Archive,</p>
<p>503<br>00:30:09,720 –&gt; 00:30:12,480<br>has promised to show it to me.</p>
<p>504<br>00:30:12,480 –&gt; 00:30:15,120</p>
<ul>
<li>If we can find it. </li>
<li>No, we’re on the wrong floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>505<br>00:30:15,120 –&gt; 00:30:17,440<br>Wrong floor, OK. Right!</p>
<p>506<br>00:30:17,440 –&gt; 00:30:19,560<br>Oh, look.</p>
<p>507<br>00:30:19,560 –&gt; 00:30:21,440<br>Can we take an apple?</p>
<p>508<br>00:30:21,440 –&gt; 00:30:24,000<br>‘No, wrong mathematician.</p>
<p>509<br>00:30:24,000 –&gt; 00:30:26,480<br>‘Eventually, we got there.’</p>
<p>510<br>00:30:26,480 –&gt; 00:30:28,840<br>This is where the Bernoullis would have done</p>
<p>511<br>00:30:28,840 –&gt; 00:30:30,600<br>some of their mathematics.</p>
<p>512<br>00:30:30,600 –&gt; 00:30:33,680<br>‘I was really just being polite.</p>
<p>513<br>00:30:33,680 –&gt; 00:30:36,400<br>‘The only thing of interest was an old stove.’</p>
<p>514<br>00:30:36,400 –&gt; 00:30:40,200<br>Now, of the Bernoullis, which is your favourite?</p>
<p>515<br>00:30:40,200 –&gt; 00:30:44,080<br>My favourite Bernoulli is Johann I.</p>
<p>516<br>00:30:44,080 –&gt; 00:30:49,640<br>He is the most smart mathematician.</p>
<p>517<br>00:30:49,640 –&gt; 00:30:54,160<br>Perhaps his brother Jakob was the mathematician</p>
<p>518<br>00:30:54,160 –&gt; 00:30:57,160<br>with the deeper insight into problems,</p>
<p>519<br>00:30:57,160 –&gt; 00:30:59,800<br>but Johann found elegant solutions.</p>
<p>520<br>00:30:59,800 –&gt; 00:31:03,920<br>The brothers didn’t like each other much, but both worshipped Leibniz.</p>
<p>521<br>00:31:03,920 –&gt; 00:31:06,560<br>They corresponded with him, stood up for him</p>
<p>522<br>00:31:06,560 –&gt; 00:31:10,960<br>against Newton’s allies, and spread his calculus throughout Europe.</p>
<p>523<br>00:31:10,960 –&gt; 00:31:15,440<br>Leibnitz was very happy to have found two gifted mathematicians</p>
<p>524<br>00:31:15,440 –&gt; 00:31:20,640<br>outside of his personal circle of friends who mastered his calculus</p>
<p>525<br>00:31:20,640 –&gt; 00:31:23,680<br>and could distribute it in the scientific community.</p>
<p>526<br>00:31:23,680 –&gt; 00:31:28,320</p>
<ul>
<li>That was very important for Leibniz. </li>
<li>And important for maths, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>527<br>00:31:28,320 –&gt; 00:31:32,440<br>Without the Bernoullis, it would have taken much longer for calculus</p>
<p>528<br>00:31:32,440 –&gt; 00:31:36,200<br>to become what it is today, a cornerstone of mathematics.</p>
<p>529<br>00:31:36,200 –&gt; 00:31:38,760<br>At least, that is Dr Nagel’s contention.</p>
<p>530<br>00:31:38,760 –&gt; 00:31:41,240<br>And he is a great Bernoulli fan.</p>
<p>531<br>00:31:41,240 –&gt; 00:31:44,520<br>He has arranged for me to meet Professor Daniel Bernoulli,</p>
<p>532<br>00:31:44,520 –&gt; 00:31:46,960<br>the latest member of the family,</p>
<p>533<br>00:31:46,960 –&gt; 00:31:49,680<br>whose famous name ensures he gets some odd e-mails.</p>
<p>534<br>00:31:49,680 –&gt; 00:31:51,320<br>Another one of which I got was,</p>
<p>535<br>00:31:51,320 –&gt; 00:31:54,440<br>“Professor Bernoulli, can you give me a hand with calculus?”</p>
<p>536<br>00:31:54,440 –&gt; 00:31:58,560<br>To find a Bernoulli, you expect them to be able to do calculus.</p>
<p>537<br>00:31:58,560 –&gt; 00:32:02,640<br>‘But this Daniel Bernoulli is a professor of geology.</p>
<p>538<br>00:32:02,640 –&gt; 00:32:05,880<br>‘The maths gene seems to have truly died out.</p>
<p>539<br>00:32:05,880 –&gt; 00:32:07,880<br>‘And during our very hearty dinner,</p>
<p>540<br>00:32:07,880 –&gt; 00:32:11,200<br>‘I found myself wandering back to maths.’</p>
<p>541<br>00:32:11,200 –&gt; 00:32:14,400<br>It is a bit unfair on the Bernoullis to describe them simply</p>
<p>542<br>00:32:14,400 –&gt; 00:32:16,040<br>as disciples of Leibniz.</p>
<p>543<br>00:32:16,040 –&gt; 00:32:18,960<br>One of their many great contributions to mathematics</p>
<p>544<br>00:32:18,960 –&gt; 00:32:23,800<br>was to develop the calculus to solve a classic problem of the day.</p>
<p>545<br>00:32:23,800 –&gt; 00:32:26,360<br>Imagine a ball rolling down a ramp.</p>
<p>546<br>00:32:26,360 –&gt; 00:32:29,320<br>The task is to design a ramp that will get the ball</p>
<p>547<br>00:32:29,320 –&gt; 00:32:32,440<br>from the top to the bottom in the fastest time possible.</p>
<p>548<br>00:32:32,440 –&gt; 00:32:36,080<br>You might think that a straight ramp would be quickest.</p>
<p>549<br>00:32:36,080 –&gt; 00:32:37,920<br>Or possibly a curved one like this</p>
<p>550<br>00:32:37,920 –&gt; 00:32:40,720<br>that gives the ball plenty of downward momentum.</p>
<p>551<br>00:32:40,720 –&gt; 00:32:42,880<br>In fact, it’s neither of these.</p>
<p>552<br>00:32:42,880 –&gt; 00:32:45,960<br>Calculus shows that it is what we call a cycloid,</p>
<p>553<br>00:32:45,960 –&gt; 00:32:49,640<br>the path traced by a point on the rim of a moving bicycle wheel.</p>
<p>554<br>00:32:49,640 –&gt; 00:32:53,360<br>This application of the calculus by the Bernoullis, which became known</p>
<p>555<br>00:32:53,360 –&gt; 00:32:55,520<br>as the calculus of variation,</p>
<p>556<br>00:32:55,520 –&gt; 00:32:58,600<br>has become one of the most powerful aspects of the mathematics</p>
<p>557<br>00:32:58,600 –&gt; 00:33:01,560<br>of Leibniz and Newton. Investors use it to maximise profits.</p>
<p>558<br>00:33:01,560 –&gt; 00:33:05,240<br>Engineers exploit it to minimise energy use.</p>
<p>559<br>00:33:05,240 –&gt; 00:33:08,560<br>Designers apply it to optimise construction.</p>
<p>560<br>00:33:08,560 –&gt; 00:33:10,680<br>It has now become one of the linchpins</p>
<p>561<br>00:33:10,680 –&gt; 00:33:12,840<br>of our modern technological world.</p>
<p>562<br>00:33:12,840 –&gt; 00:33:17,160<br>Meanwhile, things were getting more interesting in the restaurant.</p>
<p>563<br>00:33:17,160 –&gt; 00:33:18,760<br>Here is my second surprise.</p>
<p>564<br>00:33:18,760 –&gt; 00:33:22,000<br>Let me introduce Mr Leonhard Euler.</p>
<p>565<br>00:33:22,000 –&gt; 00:33:23,720<br>Daniel Bernoulli.</p>
<p>566<br>00:33:23,720 –&gt; 00:33:27,920<br>‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, one of the most famous names in mathematics.</p>
<p>567<br>00:33:27,920 –&gt; 00:33:29,600<br>‘This Leonhard is a descendant</p>
<p>568<br>00:33:29,600 –&gt; 00:33:34,080<br>‘of the original Leonhard Euler, star pupil of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli">Johann Bernoulli</a>.’</p>
<p>569<br>00:33:34,080 –&gt; 00:33:36,640<br>I am the ninth generation,</p>
<p>570<br>00:33:36,640 –&gt; 00:33:39,840<br>the fourth Leonhard in our family</p>
<p>571<br>00:33:39,840 –&gt; 00:33:42,440<br>after Leonard Euler I, the mathematician.</p>
<p>572<br>00:33:42,440 –&gt; 00:33:44,840<br>OK. And yourself, are you a mathematician?</p>
<p>573<br>00:33:44,840 –&gt; 00:33:47,840<br>Actually, I am a business analyst.</p>
<p>574<br>00:33:47,840 –&gt; 00:33:51,920<br>I can’t study mathematics with my name.</p>
<p>575<br>00:33:51,920 –&gt; 00:33:55,320<br>Everyone will expect you to prove that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>!</p>
<p>576<br>00:33:55,320 –&gt; 00:33:58,600<br>Perhaps it’s just as well that Leonhard decided</p>
<p>577<br>00:33:58,600 –&gt; 00:34:02,240<br>not to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestor.</p>
<p>578<br>00:34:02,240 –&gt; 00:34:04,600<br>He’d have had a lot to live up to.</p>
<p>579<br>00:34:13,000 –&gt; 00:34:15,000<br>I am going in a boat across the Rhine,</p>
<p>580<br>00:34:15,000 –&gt; 00:34:17,560<br>and I’m feeling a little bit worse for wear.</p>
<p>581<br>00:34:17,560 –&gt; 00:34:21,120<br>Last night’s dinner with Mr Euler and Professor Bernoulli</p>
<p>582<br>00:34:21,120 –&gt; 00:34:25,480<br>degenerated into toasts to all the theorems the Bernoullis and Eulers</p>
<p>583<br>00:34:25,480 –&gt; 00:34:28,600<br>have proved, and by God, they have proved quite a lot of them!</p>
<p>584<br>00:34:28,600 –&gt; 00:34:30,880<br>Never again.</p>
<p>585<br>00:34:30,880 –&gt; 00:34:34,800<br>I was getting disapproving glances from my fellow passengers as well.</p>
<p>586<br>00:34:34,800 –&gt; 00:34:37,360<br>Luckily, it was only a short trip.</p>
<p>587<br>00:34:37,360 –&gt; 00:34:41,960<br>Not like the trip that Euler took in 1728 to start a new life.</p>
<p>588<br>00:34:41,960 –&gt; 00:34:45,240<br>Euler may have been the prodigy of Johann Bernoulli,</p>
<p>589<br>00:34:45,240 –&gt; 00:34:47,800<br>but there was no room for him in the city.</p>
<p>590<br>00:34:47,800 –&gt; 00:34:49,520<br>If your name wasn’t Bernoulli,</p>
<p>591<br>00:34:49,520 –&gt; 00:34:53,240<br>there was little chance of getting a job in mathematics here in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel">Basel</a>.</p>
<p>592<br>00:34:53,240 –&gt; 00:34:55,600<br>But Daniel, the son of Johann Bernoulli,</p>
<p>593<br>00:34:55,600 –&gt; 00:34:57,120<br>was a great friend of Euler</p>
<p>594<br>00:34:57,120 –&gt; 00:35:00,360<br>and managed to get him a job at his university.</p>
<p>595<br>00:35:00,360 –&gt; 00:35:03,280<br>But to get there would take seven weeks,</p>
<p>596<br>00:35:03,280 –&gt; 00:35:05,800<br>because Daniel’s university was in Russia.</p>
<p>597<br>00:35:08,280 –&gt; 00:35:11,720<br>It wasn’t an intellectual powerhouse like Berlin or Paris,</p>
<p>598<br>00:35:11,720 –&gt; 00:35:17,320<br>but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</a> was by no means unsophisticated in the 18th century.</p>
<p>599<br>00:35:17,320 –&gt; 00:35:21,440<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Great">Peter the Great</a> had created a city very much in the European style.</p>
<p>600<br>00:35:21,440 –&gt; 00:35:26,080<br>And every fashionable city at the time had a scientific academy.</p>
<p>601<br>00:35:27,840 –&gt; 00:35:30,040<br>Peter’s Academy is now a museum.</p>
<p>602<br>00:35:30,040 –&gt; 00:35:34,320<br>It includes several rooms full of the kind of grotesque curiosities</p>
<p>603<br>00:35:34,320 –&gt; 00:35:38,000<br>that are usually kept out of the public display in the West.</p>
<p>604<br>00:35:38,000 –&gt; 00:35:39,960<br>But in the 1730s,</p>
<p>605<br>00:35:39,960 –&gt; 00:35:44,400<br>this building was a centre for ground-breaking research.</p>
<p>606<br>00:35:44,400 –&gt; 00:35:46,880<br>It is where Euler found his intellectual home.</p>
<p>607<br>00:35:50,280 –&gt; 00:35:57,000</p>
<h1 id="I-am-sure-that-there-could-never-be-a-more-contented-man-than-me…"><a href="#I-am-sure-that-there-could-never-be-a-more-contented-man-than-me…" class="headerlink" title="I am sure that there could never be a more contented man than me…"></a>I am sure that there could never be a more contented man than me…</h1><p>608<br>00:35:58,000 –&gt; 00:36:00,840<br>Many of the ideas that were bubbling away at the time -</p>
<p>609<br>00:36:00,840 –&gt; 00:36:02,480<br>calculus of variation,</p>
<p>610<br>00:36:02,480 –&gt; 00:36:06,560<br>Fermat’s theory of numbers - crystallised in Euler’s hands.</p>
<p>611<br>00:36:06,560 –&gt; 00:36:09,560<br>But he was also creating incredibly modern mathematics,</p>
<p>612<br>00:36:09,560 –&gt; 00:36:12,040<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis">analysis</a>.</p>
<p>613<br>00:36:12,040 –&gt; 00:36:15,240<br>Much of the notation that I use today as a mathematician</p>
<p>614<br>00:36:15,240 –&gt; 00:36:19,240<br>was created by Euler, numbers like e and i.</p>
<p>615<br>00:36:19,240 –&gt; 00:36:23,000<br>Euler also popularised the use of the symbol pi.</p>
<p>616<br>00:36:23,000 –&gt; 00:36:25,200<br>He even combined these numbers together</p>
<p>617<br>00:36:25,200 –&gt; 00:36:28,120<br>in one of the most beautiful formulas of mathematics,</p>
<p>618<br>00:36:28,120 –&gt; 00:36:32,920<br>e to the power of i times pi is equal to -1.</p>
<p>619<br>00:36:32,920 –&gt; 00:36:36,600<br>An amazing feat of mathematical alchemy.</p>
<p>620<br>00:36:36,600 –&gt; 00:36:39,960<br>His life, in fact, is full of mathematical magic.</p>
<p>621<br>00:36:39,960 –&gt; 00:36:43,560<br>Euler applied his skills to an immense range of topics,</p>
<p>622<br>00:36:43,560 –&gt; 00:36:46,440<br>from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a> to optics to astronomy.</p>
<p>623<br>00:36:46,440 –&gt; 00:36:49,840<br>He devised a new system of weights and measures, wrote a textbook</p>
<p>624<br>00:36:49,840 –&gt; 00:36:54,520<br>on mechanics, and even found time to develop a new theory of music.</p>
<p>625<br>00:36:59,360 –&gt; 00:37:01,440<br>I think of him as the Mozart of maths.</p>
<p>626<br>00:37:01,440 –&gt; 00:37:04,800<br>And that view is shared by the mathematician <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vavilov">Nikolai Vavilov</a>,</p>
<p>627<br>00:37:04,800 –&gt; 00:37:07,360<br>who met me at the house that was given to Euler</p>
<p>628<br>00:37:07,360 –&gt; 00:37:10,040<br>by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great">Catherine the Great</a>.</p>
<p>629<br>00:37:10,040 –&gt; 00:37:14,360<br>Euler lived here from ‘66 to ‘83, which means from the year</p>
<p>630<br>00:37:14,360 –&gt; 00:37:17,640<br>he came back to St Petersburg to the year he died.</p>
<p>631<br>00:37:17,640 –&gt; 00:37:22,720<br>And he was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>632<br>00:37:22,720 –&gt; 00:37:24,760<br>and their greatest mathematician.</p>
<p>633<br>00:37:24,760 –&gt; 00:37:27,360<br>That is exactly what it says.</p>
<p>634<br>00:37:27,360 –&gt; 00:37:29,360</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it now?</li>
<li>It is a school.</li>
</ul>
<p>635<br>00:37:29,360 –&gt; 00:37:30,920<br>Shall we go in and see?</p>
<p>636<br>00:37:30,920 –&gt; 00:37:33,760<br>OK.</p>
<p>637<br>00:37:33,760 –&gt; 00:37:38,920<br>‘I’m not sure Nikolai entirely approved. But nothing ventured…’</p>
<p>638<br>00:37:38,920 –&gt; 00:37:41,320<br>Perhaps we should talk to the head teacher.</p>
<p>639<br>00:37:46,200 –&gt; 00:37:48,320<br>The head didn’t mind at all.</p>
<p>640<br>00:37:48,320 –&gt; 00:37:50,680<br>I rather got the impression that she was used</p>
<p>641<br>00:37:50,680 –&gt; 00:37:53,200<br>to people dropping in to talk about Euler.</p>
<p>642<br>00:37:53,200 –&gt; 00:37:57,040<br>She even had a couple of very able pupils suspiciously close to hand.</p>
<p>643<br>00:37:57,040 –&gt; 00:38:02,240<br>These two young ladies are ready to tell a few words about the scientist</p>
<p>644<br>00:38:02,240 –&gt; 00:38:04,400<br>and about this very building.</p>
<p>645<br>00:38:04,400 –&gt; 00:38:06,200<br>They certainly knew their stuff.</p>
<p>646<br>00:38:06,200 –&gt; 00:38:09,880<br>They had undertaken an entire classroom project on Euler,</p>
<p>647<br>00:38:09,880 –&gt; 00:38:13,160<br>his long life, happy marriage and 13 children.</p>
<p>648<br>00:38:13,160 –&gt; 00:38:16,160<br>And then his tragedies - only five of his children</p>
<p>649<br>00:38:16,160 –&gt; 00:38:17,720<br>survived to adulthood.</p>
<p>650<br>00:38:17,720 –&gt; 00:38:21,200<br>His first wife, who he adored, died young.</p>
<p>651<br>00:38:21,200 –&gt; 00:38:23,640<br>He started losing most of his eyesight.</p>
<p>652<br>00:38:26,720 –&gt; 00:38:31,480<br>So for the last years of his life, he still continued to work, actually.</p>
<p>653<br>00:38:31,480 –&gt; 00:38:34,560<br>He continued his mathematical research.</p>
<p>654<br>00:38:34,560 –&gt; 00:38:36,480<br>I read a quote that said now with his blindness,</p>
<p>655<br>00:38:36,480 –&gt; 00:38:38,640<br>he hasn’t got any distractions,</p>
<p>656<br>00:38:38,640 –&gt; 00:38:42,480<br>he can finally get on with his mathematics. A positive attitude.</p>
<p>657<br>00:38:42,480 –&gt; 00:38:46,200<br>It was a totally unexpected and charming visit.</p>
<p>658<br>00:38:46,200 –&gt; 00:38:49,200<br>Although I couldn’t resist sneaking back and correcting</p>
<p>659<br>00:38:49,200 –&gt; 00:38:53,640<br>one of the equations on the board when everyone else had left.</p>
<p>660<br>00:38:54,960 –&gt; 00:38:59,960<br>To demonstrate one of my favourite Euler theorems, I needed a drink.</p>
<p>661<br>00:38:59,960 –&gt; 00:39:02,920<br>It concerns calculating infinite sums,</p>
<p>662<br>00:39:02,920 –&gt; 00:39:06,280<br>the discovery that shot Euler to the top of the mathematical pops</p>
<p>663<br>00:39:06,280 –&gt; 00:39:08,840<br>when it was announced in 1735.</p>
<p>664<br>00:39:11,120 –&gt; 00:39:15,680<br>Take one shot glass full of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodka">vodka</a> and add it to this tall glass here.</p>
<p>665<br>00:39:17,960 –&gt; 00:39:22,400<br>Next, take a glass which is a quarter full, or a half squared,</p>
<p>666<br>00:39:22,400 –&gt; 00:39:24,120<br>and add it to the first glass.</p>
<p>667<br>00:39:25,880 –&gt; 00:39:30,240<br>Next, take a glass which is a ninth full, or a third squared,</p>
<p>668<br>00:39:30,240 –&gt; 00:39:31,920<br>and add that one.</p>
<p>669<br>00:39:31,920 –&gt; 00:39:36,880<br>Now, if I keep on adding infinitely many glasses where each one</p>
<p>670<br>00:39:36,880 –&gt; 00:39:43,200<br>is a fraction squared, how much will be in this tall glass here?</p>
<p>671<br>00:39:43,200 –&gt; 00:39:45,080<br>It was called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem">Basel problem</a></p>
<p>672<br>00:39:45,080 –&gt; 00:39:47,760<br>after the Bernoullis tried and failed to solve it.</p>
<p>673<br>00:39:47,760 –&gt; 00:39:52,600<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a> knew that you would not get an infinite amount of vodka.</p>
<p>674<br>00:39:52,600 –&gt; 00:39:57,280<br>He estimated that the total would come to about one and three fifths.</p>
<p>675<br>00:39:57,280 –&gt; 00:39:59,280<br>But then Euler came along.</p>
<p>676<br>00:39:59,280 –&gt; 00:40:03,520<br>Daniel was close, but mathematics is about precision.</p>
<p>677<br>00:40:03,520 –&gt; 00:40:06,640<br>Euler calculated that the total height of the vodka</p>
<p>678<br>00:40:06,640 –&gt; 00:40:10,960<br>would be exactly pi squared divided by six.</p>
<p>679<br>00:40:13,040 –&gt; 00:40:15,160<br>It was a complete surprise.</p>
<p>680<br>00:40:15,160 –&gt; 00:40:17,800<br>What on earth did adding squares of fractions</p>
<p>681<br>00:40:17,800 –&gt; 00:40:20,520<br>have to do with the special number pi?</p>
<p>682<br>00:40:20,520 –&gt; 00:40:23,600<br>But Euler’s analysis showed that they were two sides</p>
<p>683<br>00:40:23,600 –&gt; 00:40:25,240<br>of the same equation.</p>
<p>684<br>00:40:25,240 –&gt; 00:40:29,280<br>One plus a quarter plus a ninth plus a sixteenth</p>
<p>685<br>00:40:29,280 –&gt; 00:40:34,560<br>and so on to infinity is equal to pi squared over six.</p>
<p>686<br>00:40:34,560 –&gt; 00:40:38,080<br>That’s still quite a lot of vodka, but here goes.</p>
<p>687<br>00:40:43,280 –&gt; 00:40:46,440<br>Euler would certainly be a hard act to follow.</p>
<p>688<br>00:40:46,440 –&gt; 00:40:49,560<br>Mathematicians from two countries would try.</p>
<p>689<br>00:40:49,560 –&gt; 00:40:53,680<br>Both France and Germany were caught up in the age of revolution</p>
<p>690<br>00:40:53,680 –&gt; 00:40:56,960<br>that was sweeping Europe in the late 18th century.</p>
<p>691<br>00:40:56,960 –&gt; 00:40:59,760<br>Both desperately needed mathematicians.</p>
<p>692<br>00:40:59,760 –&gt; 00:41:04,600<br>But they went about supporting mathematics rather differently.</p>
<p>693<br>00:41:04,600 –&gt; 00:41:05,960<br>Here in France,</p>
<p>694<br>00:41:05,960 –&gt; 00:41:09,560<br>the Revolution emphasised the usefulness of mathematics.</p>
<p>695<br>00:41:09,560 –&gt; 00:41:12,280<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Napoleon</a> recognised that if you were going to have</p>
<p>696<br>00:41:12,280 –&gt; 00:41:14,920<br>the best military machine, the best weaponry,</p>
<p>697<br>00:41:14,920 –&gt; 00:41:17,720<br>then you needed the best mathematicians.</p>
<p>698<br>00:41:17,720 –&gt; 00:41:21,120<br>Napoleon’s reforms gave mathematics a big boost.</p>
<p>699<br>00:41:21,120 –&gt; 00:41:24,400<br>But this was a mathematics that was going to serve society.</p>
<p>700<br>00:41:25,920 –&gt; 00:41:30,000<br>Here in the German states, the great educationalist <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Wilhelm von Humboldt</a></p>
<p>701<br>00:41:30,000 –&gt; 00:41:33,840<br>was also committed to mathematics, but a mathematics that was detached</p>
<p>702<br>00:41:33,840 –&gt; 00:41:36,360<br>from the demands of the State and the military.</p>
<p>703<br>00:41:36,360 –&gt; 00:41:42,200<br>Von Humboldt’s educational reforms valued mathematics for its own sake.</p>
<p>704<br>00:41:42,200 –&gt; 00:41:46,080<br>In France, they got wonderful mathematicians, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier">Joseph Fourier</a>,</p>
<p>705<br>00:41:46,080 –&gt; 00:41:49,280<br>whose work on sound waves we still benefit from today.</p>
<p>706<br>00:41:49,280 –&gt; 00:41:53,360<br>MP3 technology is based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis">Fourier analysis</a>.</p>
<p>707<br>00:41:53,360 –&gt; 00:41:56,680<br>But in Germany, they got, at least in my opinion,</p>
<p>708<br>00:41:56,680 –&gt; 00:41:58,680<br>the greatest mathematician ever.</p>
<p>709<br>00:42:01,960 –&gt; 00:42:03,920<br>Quaint and quiet,</p>
<p>710<br>00:42:03,920 –&gt; 00:42:08,080<br>the university town of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen">Gottingen</a> may seem like a bit of a backwater.</p>
<p>711<br>00:42:08,080 –&gt; 00:42:12,000<br>But this little town has been home to some of the giants of maths,</p>
<p>712<br>00:42:12,000 –&gt; 00:42:14,320<br>including the man who’s often described</p>
<p>713<br>00:42:14,320 –&gt; 00:42:19,360<br>as the Prince of Mathematics, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>.</p>
<p>714<br>00:42:19,360 –&gt; 00:42:23,240<br>Few non-mathematicians, however, seem to know anything about him.</p>
<p>715<br>00:42:23,240 –&gt; 00:42:25,040<br>Not in Paris.</p>
<p>716<br>00:42:25,040 –&gt; 00:42:27,000<br>Qui s’appelle Carl Friedrich Gauss?</p>
<p>717<br>00:42:27,000 –&gt; 00:42:28,880</p>
<ul>
<li>Non.</li>
<li>Non?</li>
</ul>
<p>718<br>00:42:28,880 –&gt; 00:42:30,480<br>‘Not in Oxford.’</p>
<p>719<br>00:42:30,480 –&gt; 00:42:34,440</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve heard the name but I couldn’t tell you.</li>
<li>No idea.</li>
<li>No idea?</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>720<br>00:42:34,440 –&gt; 00:42:37,480<br>‘And I’m afraid to say, not even in modern Germany.’</p>
<p>721<br>00:42:37,480 –&gt; 00:42:39,400</p>
<ul>
<li>Nein.</li>
<li>Nein? OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>722<br>00:42:39,400 –&gt; 00:42:41,040</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t know.</li>
<li>You don’t know?</li>
</ul>
<p>723<br>00:42:41,040 –&gt; 00:42:44,600<br>But in Gottingen, everyone knows who Gauss is.</p>
<p>724<br>00:42:44,600 –&gt; 00:42:47,040<br>He’s the local hero.</p>
<p>725<br>00:42:47,040 –&gt; 00:42:49,440<br>His father was a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonemasonry">stonemason</a></p>
<p>726<br>00:42:49,440 –&gt; 00:42:52,560<br>and it’s likely that Gauss would have become one, too.</p>
<p>727<br>00:42:52,560 –&gt; 00:42:55,720<br>But his singular talent was recognised by his mother,</p>
<p>728<br>00:42:55,720 –&gt; 00:42:57,560<br>and she helped ensure</p>
<p>729<br>00:42:57,560 –&gt; 00:43:01,320<br>that he received the best possible education.</p>
<p>730<br>00:43:01,320 –&gt; 00:43:05,080<br>Every few years in the news, you hear about a new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy">prodigy</a></p>
<p>731<br>00:43:05,080 –&gt; 00:43:08,240<br>who’s passed their A-levels at ten, gone to university at 12,</p>
<p>732<br>00:43:08,240 –&gt; 00:43:10,240<br>but nobody compares to Gauss.</p>
<p>733<br>00:43:10,240 –&gt; 00:43:13,680<br>Already at the age of 12, he was criticising Euclid’s geometry.</p>
<p>734<br>00:43:13,680 –&gt; 00:43:16,960<br>At 15, he discovered a new pattern in prime numbers</p>
<p>735<br>00:43:16,960 –&gt; 00:43:20,240<br>which had eluded mathematicians for 2,000 years.</p>
<p>736<br>00:43:20,240 –&gt; 00:43:24,000<br>And at 19, he discovered the construction of a 17-sided figure</p>
<p>737<br>00:43:24,000 –&gt; 00:43:26,880<br>which nobody had known before this time.</p>
<p>738<br>00:43:30,200 –&gt; 00:43:34,160<br>His early successes encouraged Gauss to keep a diary.</p>
<p>739<br>00:43:34,160 –&gt; 00:43:36,120<br>Here at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Gottingen</a>,</p>
<p>740<br>00:43:36,120 –&gt; 00:43:40,000<br>you can still read it if you can understand Latin.</p>
<p>741<br>00:43:40,000 –&gt; 00:43:42,120<br>Fortunately, I had help.</p>
<p>742<br>00:43:44,200 –&gt; 00:43:46,960<br>The first entry is in 1796.</p>
<p>743<br>00:43:46,960 –&gt; 00:43:49,600</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to lift it up? </li>
<li>Yes, but be careful.</li>
</ul>
<p>744<br>00:43:49,600 –&gt; 00:43:54,160<br>It’s really one of the most valuable things that this library possesses.</p>
<p>745<br>00:43:54,160 –&gt; 00:43:56,680</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I can believe that. </li>
<li>He writes beautifully.</li>
</ul>
<p>746<br>00:43:56,680 –&gt; 00:43:59,120<br>It is aesthetically very pleasing,</p>
<p>747<br>00:43:59,120 –&gt; 00:44:02,560<br>even if people don’t understand what it is.</p>
<p>748<br>00:44:02,560 –&gt; 00:44:05,320<br>I’m going to put this down. It’s very delicate.</p>
<p>749<br>00:44:05,320 –&gt; 00:44:08,520<br>The diary proves that some of Gauss’ ideas</p>
<p>750<br>00:44:08,520 –&gt; 00:44:10,240<br>were 100 years ahead of their time.</p>
<p>751<br>00:44:10,240 –&gt; 00:44:15,520<br>Here are some sines and integrals. Very different sort of mathematics.</p>
<p>752<br>00:44:15,520 –&gt; 00:44:20,400<br>Yes, this was the first intimations of the theory</p>
<p>753<br>00:44:20,400 –&gt; 00:44:25,040<br>of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_function">elliptic functions</a>, which was one of his other great developments.</p>
<p>754<br>00:44:25,040 –&gt; 00:44:28,600<br>And here you see something that is basically</p>
<p>755<br>00:44:28,600 –&gt; 00:44:30,720<br>the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function">Riemann zeta function</a> appearing.</p>
<p>756<br>00:44:30,720 –&gt; 00:44:34,200<br>Wow, gosh! That’s very impressive.</p>
<p>757<br>00:44:34,200 –&gt; 00:44:38,880<br>The zeta function has become a vital element in our present understanding</p>
<p>758<br>00:44:38,880 –&gt; 00:44:43,600<br>of the distribution of the building blocks of all numbers, the primes.</p>
<p>759<br>00:44:43,600 –&gt; 00:44:47,280<br>There is somewhere in the diary here where he says,</p>
<p>760<br>00:44:47,280 –&gt; 00:44:49,280<br>“I have made this wonderful discovery</p>
<p>761<br>00:44:49,280 –&gt; 00:44:52,000<br>“and incidentally, a son was born today.”</p>
<p>762<br>00:44:52,000 –&gt; 00:44:53,640<br>We see his priorities!</p>
<p>763<br>00:44:53,640 –&gt; 00:44:55,560<br>Yes, indeed!</p>
<p>764<br>00:44:55,560 –&gt; 00:44:58,600<br>I think I know a few mathematicians like that, too.</p>
<p>765<br>00:45:00,320 –&gt; 00:45:03,800<br>My priorities, though, for the rest of the afternoon were clear.</p>
<p>766<br>00:45:03,800 –&gt; 00:45:05,560<br>I needed another walk.</p>
<p>767<br>00:45:05,560 –&gt; 00:45:08,960<br>Fortunately, Gottingen is surrounded by good woodland trails.</p>
<p>768<br>00:45:08,960 –&gt; 00:45:10,920<br>It was a perfect setting for me</p>
<p>769<br>00:45:10,920 –&gt; 00:45:13,440<br>to think more about Gauss’ discoveries.</p>
<p>770<br>00:45:22,400 –&gt; 00:45:26,280<br>Gauss’ mathematics has touched many parts of the mathematical world,</p>
<p>771<br>00:45:26,280 –&gt; 00:45:31,320<br>but I’m going to just choose one of them, a fun one - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number">imaginary numbers</a>.</p>
<p>772<br>00:45:31,320 –&gt; 00:45:34,920<br>In the 16th and 17th century, European mathematicians</p>
<p>773<br>00:45:34,920 –&gt; 00:45:40,120<br>imagined the square root of minus one and gave it the symbol i.</p>
<p>774<br>00:45:40,120 –&gt; 00:45:42,760<br>They didn’t like it much, but it solved equations</p>
<p>775<br>00:45:42,760 –&gt; 00:45:45,240<br>that couldn’t be solved any other way.</p>
<p>776<br>00:45:46,320 –&gt; 00:45:49,760<br>Imaginary numbers have helped us to understand radio waves,</p>
<p>777<br>00:45:49,760 –&gt; 00:45:52,000<br>to build bridges and aeroplanes.</p>
<p>778<br>00:45:52,000 –&gt; 00:45:54,240<br>They’re even the key to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum physics</a>,</p>
<p>779<br>00:45:54,240 –&gt; 00:45:56,560<br>the science of the sub-atomic world.</p>
<p>780<br>00:45:56,560 –&gt; 00:46:01,400<br>They’ve provided a map to see how things really are.</p>
<p>781<br>00:46:01,400 –&gt; 00:46:05,560<br>But back in the early 19th century, they had no map, no picture</p>
<p>782<br>00:46:05,560 –&gt; 00:46:08,560<br>of how imaginary numbers connected with real numbers.</p>
<p>783<br>00:46:08,560 –&gt; 00:46:10,760<br>Where is this new number?</p>
<p>784<br>00:46:10,760 –&gt; 00:46:14,240<br>There’s no room on the number line for the square root of minus one.</p>
<p>785<br>00:46:14,240 –&gt; 00:46:16,320<br>I’ve got the positive numbers running out here,</p>
<p>786<br>00:46:16,320 –&gt; 00:46:17,880<br>the negative numbers here.</p>
<p>787<br>00:46:17,880 –&gt; 00:46:21,600<br>The great step is to create a new direction of numbers,</p>
<p>788<br>00:46:21,600 –&gt; 00:46:23,560<br>perpendicular to the number line,</p>
<p>789<br>00:46:23,560 –&gt; 00:46:26,720<br>and that’s where the square root of minus one is.</p>
<p>790<br>00:46:28,880 –&gt; 00:46:32,600<br>Gauss was not the first to come up with this two-dimensional picture</p>
<p>791<br>00:46:32,600 –&gt; 00:46:36,720<br>of numbers, but he was the first person to explain it all clearly.</p>
<p>792<br>00:46:36,720 –&gt; 00:46:38,760<br>He gave people a picture to understand</p>
<p>793<br>00:46:38,760 –&gt; 00:46:40,920<br>how imaginary numbers worked.</p>
<p>794<br>00:46:40,920 –&gt; 00:46:43,080<br>And once they’d developed this picture,</p>
<p>795<br>00:46:43,080 –&gt; 00:46:46,200<br>their immense potential could really be unleashed.</p>
<p>796<br>00:46:46,200 –&gt; 00:46:49,680<br>Guten Morgen. Ein Kaffee, bitte.</p>
<p>797<br>00:46:49,680 –&gt; 00:46:53,120<br>His maths led to a claim and financial security for Gauss.</p>
<p>798<br>00:46:53,120 –&gt; 00:46:56,360<br>He could have gone anywhere, but he was happy enough</p>
<p>799<br>00:46:56,360 –&gt; 00:47:01,680<br>to settle down and spend the rest of his life in sleepy Gottingen.</p>
<p>800<br>00:47:01,680 –&gt; 00:47:03,920<br>Unfortunately, as his fame developed,</p>
<p>801<br>00:47:03,920 –&gt; 00:47:06,080<br>so his character deteriorated.</p>
<p>802<br>00:47:06,080 –&gt; 00:47:08,440<br>A naturally conservative, shy man,</p>
<p>803<br>00:47:08,440 –&gt; 00:47:12,760<br>he became increasingly distrustful and grumpy.</p>
<p>804<br>00:47:12,760 –&gt; 00:47:16,600<br>Many young mathematicians across Europe regarded Gauss as a god</p>
<p>805<br>00:47:16,600 –&gt; 00:47:18,720<br>and they would send in their theorems,</p>
<p>806<br>00:47:18,720 –&gt; 00:47:20,720<br>their conjectures, even some proofs.</p>
<p>807<br>00:47:20,720 –&gt; 00:47:23,560<br>But most of the time, he wouldn’t respond, and even when he did,</p>
<p>808<br>00:47:23,560 –&gt; 00:47:26,480<br>it was generally to say either that they’d got it wrong</p>
<p>809<br>00:47:26,480 –&gt; 00:47:28,480<br>or he’d proved it already.</p>
<p>810<br>00:47:28,480 –&gt; 00:47:32,600<br>His dismissal or lack of interest in the work of lesser mortals</p>
<p>811<br>00:47:32,600 –&gt; 00:47:35,360<br>sometimes discouraged some very talented mathematicians</p>
<p>812<br>00:47:35,360 –&gt; 00:47:38,120<br>from pursuing their ideas.</p>
<p>813<br>00:47:38,120 –&gt; 00:47:40,240<br>But occasionally, Gauss also failed</p>
<p>814<br>00:47:40,240 –&gt; 00:47:45,040<br>to follow up on his own insights, including one very important insight</p>
<p>815<br>00:47:45,040 –&gt; 00:47:48,240<br>that might have transformed the mathematics of his time.</p>
<p>816<br>00:47:50,400 –&gt; 00:47:53,640<br>15 kilometres outside Gottingen stands what is known today</p>
<p>817<br>00:47:53,640 –&gt; 00:47:55,640<br>as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_Tower">Gauss Tower</a>.</p>
<p>818<br>00:47:55,640 –&gt; 00:47:57,960<br>Wow, that is stunning.</p>
<p>819<br>00:47:57,960 –&gt; 00:48:01,640<br>It is really a fantastic view here, yes.</p>
<p>820<br>00:48:01,640 –&gt; 00:48:05,040<br>Gauss took on many projects for the Hanoverian government,</p>
<p>821<br>00:48:05,040 –&gt; 00:48:09,320<br>including the first proper survey of all the lands of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover">Hanover</a>.</p>
<p>822<br>00:48:09,320 –&gt; 00:48:12,560<br>Was this Gauss’ choice to do this surveying?</p>
<p>823<br>00:48:12,560 –&gt; 00:48:16,120<br>For a mathematician, it sounds like the last thing I’d want to do.</p>
<p>824<br>00:48:16,120 –&gt; 00:48:17,320<br>He wanted to do it.</p>
<p>825<br>00:48:17,320 –&gt; 00:48:23,280<br>The major point in doing this was to discover the shape of the earth.</p>
<p>826<br>00:48:23,280 –&gt; 00:48:25,280<br>But he also started speculating</p>
<p>827<br>00:48:25,280 –&gt; 00:48:29,880<br>about something even more revolutionary - the shape of space.</p>
<p>828<br>00:48:29,880 –&gt; 00:48:34,720<br>So he’s thinking there may not be anything flat in the universe?</p>
<p>829<br>00:48:34,720 –&gt; 00:48:37,280<br>Yes. And if we were living in a curved universe,</p>
<p>830<br>00:48:37,280 –&gt; 00:48:40,480<br>there wouldn’t be anything flat.</p>
<p>831<br>00:48:40,480 –&gt; 00:48:44,680<br>This led Gauss to question one of the central tenets of mathematics -</p>
<p>832<br>00:48:44,680 –&gt; 00:48:47,280<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Euclid’s geometry</a>.</p>
<p>833<br>00:48:47,280 –&gt; 00:48:50,160<br>He realised that this geometry, far from universal,</p>
<p>834<br>00:48:50,160 –&gt; 00:48:52,960<br>depended on the idea of space as flat.</p>
<p>835<br>00:48:52,960 –&gt; 00:48:56,160<br>It just didn’t apply to a universe that was curved.</p>
<p>836<br>00:48:56,160 –&gt; 00:48:59,520<br>But in the early 19th century, Euclid’s geometry</p>
<p>837<br>00:48:59,520 –&gt; 00:49:03,320<br>was seen as God-given and Gauss didn’t want any trouble.</p>
<p>838<br>00:49:03,320 –&gt; 00:49:05,640<br>So he never published anything.</p>
<p>839<br>00:49:05,640 –&gt; 00:49:09,200<br>Another mathematician, though, had no such fears.</p>
<p>840<br>00:49:11,960 –&gt; 00:49:16,000<br>In mathematics, it’s often helpful to be part of a community</p>
<p>841<br>00:49:16,000 –&gt; 00:49:19,320<br>where you can talk to and bounce ideas off others.</p>
<p>842<br>00:49:19,320 –&gt; 00:49:22,160<br>But inside such a mathematical community,</p>
<p>843<br>00:49:22,160 –&gt; 00:49:25,400<br>it can sometimes be difficult to come up with that one idea</p>
<p>844<br>00:49:25,400 –&gt; 00:49:28,760<br>that completely challenges the status quo,</p>
<p>845<br>00:49:28,760 –&gt; 00:49:33,560<br>and then the breakthrough often comes from somewhere else.</p>
<p>846<br>00:49:33,560 –&gt; 00:49:36,840<br>Mathematics can be done in some pretty weird places.</p>
<p>847<br>00:49:36,840 –&gt; 00:49:38,440<br>I’m in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania">Transylvania</a>,</p>
<p>848<br>00:49:38,440 –&gt; 00:49:42,040<br>which is fairly appropriate, cos I’m in search of a lone wolf.</p>
<p>849<br>00:49:42,040 –&gt; 00:49:45,200<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai">Janos Bolyai</a> spent much of his life</p>
<p>850<br>00:49:45,200 –&gt; 00:49:49,520<br>hundreds of miles away from the mathematical centres of excellence.</p>
<p>851<br>00:49:49,520 –&gt; 00:49:53,600<br>This is the only portrait of him that I was able to find.</p>
<p>852<br>00:49:53,600 –&gt; 00:49:56,600<br>Unfortunately, it isn’t actually him.</p>
<p>853<br>00:49:56,600 –&gt; 00:50:00,040<br>It’s one that the Communist Party in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a> started circulating</p>
<p>854<br>00:50:00,040 –&gt; 00:50:04,000<br>when people got interested in his theories in the 1960s.</p>
<p>855<br>00:50:04,000 –&gt; 00:50:06,480<br>They couldn’t find a picture of Janos.</p>
<p>856<br>00:50:06,480 –&gt; 00:50:09,520<br>So they substituted a picture of somebody else instead.</p>
<p>857<br>00:50:11,800 –&gt; 00:50:15,520<br>Born in 1802, Janos was the son of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkas_Bolyai">Farkas Bolyai</a>,</p>
<p>858<br>00:50:15,520 –&gt; 00:50:17,120<br>who was a maths teacher.</p>
<p>859<br>00:50:17,120 –&gt; 00:50:20,400<br>He realised his son was a mathematical prodigy,</p>
<p>860<br>00:50:20,400 –&gt; 00:50:23,720<br>so he wrote to his old friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>,</p>
<p>861<br>00:50:23,720 –&gt; 00:50:25,640<br>asking him to tutor the boy.</p>
<p>862<br>00:50:25,640 –&gt; 00:50:28,880<br>Sadly, Gauss declined.</p>
<p>863<br>00:50:28,880 –&gt; 00:50:31,760<br>So instead of becoming a professional mathematician,</p>
<p>864<br>00:50:31,760 –&gt; 00:50:33,920<br>Janos joined the Army.</p>
<p>865<br>00:50:33,920 –&gt; 00:50:37,080<br>But mathematics remained his first love.</p>
<p>866<br>00:50:40,680 –&gt; 00:50:44,320<br>Maybe there’s something about the air here because Bolyai carried on</p>
<p>867<br>00:50:44,320 –&gt; 00:50:46,720<br>doing his mathematics in his spare time.</p>
<p>868<br>00:50:46,720 –&gt; 00:50:50,360<br>He started to explore what he called imaginary geometries,</p>
<p>869<br>00:50:50,360 –&gt; 00:50:55,040<br>where the angles in triangles add up to less than 180.</p>
<p>870<br>00:50:55,040 –&gt; 00:50:58,240<br>The amazing thing is that these imaginary geometries</p>
<p>871<br>00:50:58,240 –&gt; 00:51:00,720<br>make perfect mathematical sense.</p>
<p>872<br>00:51:04,520 –&gt; 00:51:09,280<br>Bolyai’s new geometry has become known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry">hyperbolic geometry</a>.</p>
<p>873<br>00:51:09,280 –&gt; 00:51:12,800<br>The best way to imagine it is a kind of mirror image of a sphere</p>
<p>874<br>00:51:12,800 –&gt; 00:51:15,440<br>where lines curve back on each other.</p>
<p>875<br>00:51:15,440 –&gt; 00:51:18,320<br>It’s difficult to represent it since we are so used</p>
<p>876<br>00:51:18,320 –&gt; 00:51:21,680<br>to living in space which appears to be straight and flat.</p>
<p>877<br>00:51:23,800 –&gt; 00:51:25,480<br>In his hometown of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2rgu_Mure%C8%99">Targu Mures</a>,</p>
<p>878<br>00:51:25,480 –&gt; 00:51:29,600<br>I went looking for more about Bolyai’s revolutionary mathematics.</p>
<p>879<br>00:51:29,600 –&gt; 00:51:33,040<br>His memory is certainly revered here.</p>
<p>880<br>00:51:33,040 –&gt; 00:51:36,760<br>The museum contains a collection of Bolyai-related artefacts,</p>
<p>881<br>00:51:36,760 –&gt; 00:51:40,520<br>some of which might be considered distinctly Transylvanian.</p>
<p>882<br>00:51:40,520 –&gt; 00:51:42,480<br>It’s still got some hair on it.</p>
<p>883<br>00:51:42,480 –&gt; 00:51:45,160<br>It’s kind of a little bit gruesome.</p>
<p>884<br>00:51:45,160 –&gt; 00:51:46,760<br>But the object I like most here</p>
<p>885<br>00:51:46,760 –&gt; 00:51:50,400<br>is a beautiful model of Bolyai’s geometry.</p>
<p>886<br>00:51:50,400 –&gt; 00:51:54,000<br>You got the shortest distance between here and here</p>
<p>887<br>00:51:54,000 –&gt; 00:51:56,760<br>if you stick on this surface. It’s not a straight line,</p>
<p>888<br>00:51:56,760 –&gt; 00:51:59,160<br>but this curved line which of bends into the triangle.</p>
<p>889<br>00:51:59,160 –&gt; 00:52:03,760<br>Here is a surface where the shortest distances which define the triangle</p>
<p>890<br>00:52:03,760 –&gt; 00:52:06,040<br>add up to less than 180.</p>
<p>891<br>00:52:06,040 –&gt; 00:52:09,440<br>Bolyai published his work in 1831.</p>
<p>892<br>00:52:09,440 –&gt; 00:52:12,360<br>His father sent his old friend Gauss a copy.</p>
<p>893<br>00:52:12,360 –&gt; 00:52:16,280<br>Gauss wrote back straightaway giving his approval,</p>
<p>894<br>00:52:16,280 –&gt; 00:52:19,440<br>but Gauss refused to praise the young Bolyai,</p>
<p>895<br>00:52:19,440 –&gt; 00:52:22,560<br>because he said the person he should be praising was himself.</p>
<p>896<br>00:52:22,560 –&gt; 00:52:26,200<br>He had worked it all out a decade or so before.</p>
<p>897<br>00:52:26,200 –&gt; 00:52:29,760<br>Actually, there is a letter from Gauss</p>
<p>898<br>00:52:29,760 –&gt; 00:52:32,200<br>to another friend of his where he says,</p>
<p>899<br>00:52:32,200 –&gt; 00:52:34,840<br>“I regard this young geometer boy</p>
<p>900<br>00:52:34,840 –&gt; 00:52:37,960<br>“as a genius of the first order.”</p>
<p>901<br>00:52:37,960 –&gt; 00:52:41,560<br>But Gauss never thought to tell Bolyai that.</p>
<p>902<br>00:52:41,560 –&gt; 00:52:44,520<br>And young Janos was completely disheartened.</p>
<p>903<br>00:52:44,520 –&gt; 00:52:47,040<br>Another body blow soon followed.</p>
<p>904<br>00:52:47,040 –&gt; 00:52:49,880<br>Somebody else had developed exactly the same idea,</p>
<p>905<br>00:52:49,880 –&gt; 00:52:52,000<br>but had published two years before him -</p>
<p>906<br>00:52:52,000 –&gt; 00:52:55,080<br>the Russian mathematician <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky">Nicholas Lobachevsky</a>.</p>
<p>907<br>00:52:57,560 –&gt; 00:53:00,080<br>It was all downhill for Bolyai after that.</p>
<p>908<br>00:53:00,080 –&gt; 00:53:04,080<br>With no recognition or career, he didn’t publish anything else.</p>
<p>909<br>00:53:04,080 –&gt; 00:53:06,960<br>Eventually, he went a little crazy.</p>
<p>910<br>00:53:08,440 –&gt; 00:53:13,160<br>In 1860, Janos Bolyai died in obscurity.</p>
<p>911<br>00:53:15,280 –&gt; 00:53:19,040<br>Gauss, by contrast, was lionised after his death.</p>
<p>912<br>00:53:19,040 –&gt; 00:53:22,560<br>A university, the units used to measure magnetic induction,</p>
<p>913<br>00:53:22,560 –&gt; 00:53:25,520<br>even a crater on the moon would be named after him.</p>
<p>914<br>00:53:28,760 –&gt; 00:53:31,600<br>During his lifetime, Gauss lent his support</p>
<p>915<br>00:53:31,600 –&gt; 00:53:33,960<br>to very few mathematicians.</p>
<p>916<br>00:53:33,960 –&gt; 00:53:38,840<br>But one exception was another of Gottingen’s mathematical giants -</p>
<p>917<br>00:53:38,840 –&gt; 00:53:41,840<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a>.</p>
<p>918<br>00:53:48,280 –&gt; 00:53:49,800<br>His father was a minister</p>
<p>919<br>00:53:49,800 –&gt; 00:53:54,080<br>and he would remain a sincere Christian all his life.</p>
<p>920<br>00:53:54,080 –&gt; 00:53:58,280<br>But Riemann grew up a shy boy who suffered from consumption.</p>
<p>921<br>00:53:58,280 –&gt; 00:54:00,640<br>His family was large and poor and the only thing</p>
<p>922<br>00:54:00,640 –&gt; 00:54:04,560<br>the young boy had going for him was an excellence at maths.</p>
<p>923<br>00:54:04,560 –&gt; 00:54:07,720<br>That was his salvation.</p>
<p>924<br>00:54:07,720 –&gt; 00:54:11,240<br>Many mathematicians like Riemann had very difficult childhoods,</p>
<p>925<br>00:54:11,240 –&gt; 00:54:14,960<br>were quite unsociable. Their lives seemed to be falling apart.</p>
<p>926<br>00:54:14,960 –&gt; 00:54:18,800<br>It was mathematics that gave them a sense of security.</p>
<p>927<br>00:54:21,920 –&gt; 00:54:24,800<br>Riemann spent much of his early life in the town of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg">Luneburg</a></p>
<p>928<br>00:54:24,800 –&gt; 00:54:26,840<br>in northern Germany.</p>
<p>929<br>00:54:26,840 –&gt; 00:54:30,440<br>This was his local school, built as a direct result</p>
<p>930<br>00:54:30,440 –&gt; 00:54:34,280<br>of Humboldt’s educational reforms in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>931<br>00:54:34,280 –&gt; 00:54:37,040<br>Riemann was one of its first pupils.</p>
<p>932<br>00:54:37,040 –&gt; 00:54:41,360<br>The head teacher saw a way of bringing out the shy boy.</p>
<p>933<br>00:54:41,360 –&gt; 00:54:44,320<br>He was given the freedom of the school’s library.</p>
<p>934<br>00:54:44,320 –&gt; 00:54:46,880<br>It opened up a whole new world to him.</p>
<p>935<br>00:54:46,880 –&gt; 00:54:48,680<br>One of the books he found in there</p>
<p>936<br>00:54:48,680 –&gt; 00:54:51,480<br>was a book by the French mathematician <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre">Legendre</a>,</p>
<p>937<br>00:54:51,480 –&gt; 00:54:53,000<br>all about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number theory</a>.</p>
<p>938<br>00:54:53,000 –&gt; 00:54:55,680<br>His teacher asked him how he was getting on with it.</p>
<p>939<br>00:54:55,680 –&gt; 00:55:01,360<br>He replied, “I have understood all 859 pages of this wonderful book.”</p>
<p>940<br>00:55:01,360 –&gt; 00:55:04,520<br>It was a strategy that obviously suited Riemann</p>
<p>941<br>00:55:04,520 –&gt; 00:55:07,080<br>because he became a brilliant mathematician.</p>
<p>942<br>00:55:07,080 –&gt; 00:55:12,280<br>One of his most famous contributions to mathematics was a lecture in 1852</p>
<p>943<br>00:55:12,280 –&gt; 00:55:16,400<br>on the foundations of geometry. In the lecture,</p>
<p>944<br>00:55:16,400 –&gt; 00:55:20,120<br>Riemann first described what geometry actually was</p>
<p>945<br>00:55:20,120 –&gt; 00:55:22,160<br>and its relationship with the world.</p>
<p>946<br>00:55:22,160 –&gt; 00:55:25,240<br>He then sketched out what geometry could be -</p>
<p>947<br>00:55:25,240 –&gt; 00:55:28,240<br>a mathematics of many different kinds of space,</p>
<p>948<br>00:55:28,240 –&gt; 00:55:31,240<br>only one of which would be the flat Euclidian space</p>
<p>949<br>00:55:31,240 –&gt; 00:55:32,880<br>in which we appear to live.</p>
<p>950<br>00:55:32,880 –&gt; 00:55:36,080<br>He was just 26 years old.</p>
<p>951<br>00:55:36,080 –&gt; 00:55:40,560<br>Was it received well? Did people recognise the revolution?</p>
<p>952<br>00:55:40,560 –&gt; 00:55:42,840<br>There was no way that people could actually</p>
<p>953<br>00:55:42,840 –&gt; 00:55:45,040<br>make these ideas concrete.</p>
<p>954<br>00:55:45,040 –&gt; 00:55:50,640<br>That only occurred 50, 60 years after this, with Einstein.</p>
<p>955<br>00:55:50,640 –&gt; 00:55:53,400<br>So this is the beginning, really, of the revolution</p>
<p>956<br>00:55:53,400 –&gt; 00:55:56,960</p>
<ul>
<li>which ends with Einstein’s relativity.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>957<br>00:55:56,960 –&gt; 00:56:01,640<br>Riemann’s mathematics changed how we see the world.</p>
<p>958<br>00:56:01,640 –&gt; 00:56:04,400<br>Suddenly, higher dimensional geometry appeared.</p>
<p>959<br>00:56:04,400 –&gt; 00:56:06,640<br>The potential was there from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">Descartes</a>,</p>
<p>960<br>00:56:06,640 –&gt; 00:56:11,120<br>but it was Riemann’s imagination that made it happen.</p>
<p>961<br>00:56:11,120 –&gt; 00:56:15,160<br>He began without putting any restriction</p>
<p>962<br>00:56:15,160 –&gt; 00:56:18,680<br>on the dimensions whatsoever. This was something quite new,</p>
<p>963<br>00:56:18,680 –&gt; 00:56:21,320<br>his way of thinking about things.</p>
<p>964<br>00:56:21,320 –&gt; 00:56:24,800<br>Someone like Bolyai was really thinking about new geometries,</p>
<p>965<br>00:56:24,800 –&gt; 00:56:26,920<br>but new two-dimensional geometries.</p>
<p>966<br>00:56:26,920 –&gt; 00:56:30,160<br>New two-dimensional geometries. Riemann then broke away</p>
<p>967<br>00:56:30,160 –&gt; 00:56:35,240<br>from all the limitations of two or three dimensions</p>
<p>968<br>00:56:35,240 –&gt; 00:56:37,880<br>and began to think in in higher dimensions.</p>
<p>969<br>00:56:37,880 –&gt; 00:56:39,400<br>And this was quite new.</p>
<p>970<br>00:56:39,400 –&gt; 00:56:41,960<br>Multi-dimensional space is at the heart</p>
<p>971<br>00:56:41,960 –&gt; 00:56:44,520<br>of so much mathematics done today.</p>
<p>972<br>00:56:44,520 –&gt; 00:56:48,080<br>In geometry, number theory, and several other branches of maths,</p>
<p>973<br>00:56:48,080 –&gt; 00:56:51,800<br>Riemann’s ideas still perplex and amaze.</p>
<p>974<br>00:56:52,760 –&gt; 00:56:55,920<br>He died, though, in 1866.</p>
<p>975<br>00:56:55,920 –&gt; 00:56:59,480<br>He was only 39 years old.</p>
<p>976<br>00:56:59,480 –&gt; 00:57:02,960<br>Today, the results of Riemann’s mathematics are everywhere.</p>
<p>977<br>00:57:02,960 –&gt; 00:57:07,520<br>Hyperspace is no longer science fiction, but science fact.</p>
<p>978<br>00:57:07,520 –&gt; 00:57:11,280<br>In Paris, they have even tried to visualise what shapes</p>
<p>979<br>00:57:11,280 –&gt; 00:57:13,880<br>in higher dimensions might look like.</p>
<p>980<br>00:57:15,680 –&gt; 00:57:18,640<br>Just as the Renaissance artist Piero would have drawn a square</p>
<p>981<br>00:57:18,640 –&gt; 00:57:22,880<br>inside a square to represent a cube on the two-dimensional canvas,</p>
<p>982<br>00:57:22,880 –&gt; 00:57:27,360<br>the architect here at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D%C3%A9fense">La Defense</a> has built a cube inside a cube</p>
<p>983<br>00:57:27,360 –&gt; 00:57:31,720<br>to represent a shadow of the four-dimensional <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">hypercube</a>.</p>
<p>984<br>00:57:31,720 –&gt; 00:57:34,640<br>It is with Riemann’s work that we finally have</p>
<p>985<br>00:57:34,640 –&gt; 00:57:37,120<br>the mathematical glasses to be able to explore</p>
<p>986<br>00:57:37,120 –&gt; 00:57:39,360<br>such worlds of the mind.</p>
<p>987<br>00:57:42,480 –&gt; 00:57:44,920<br>It’s taken a while to make these glasses fit,</p>
<p>988<br>00:57:44,920 –&gt; 00:57:47,320<br>but without this golden age of mathematics,</p>
<p>989<br>00:57:47,320 –&gt; 00:57:50,480<br>from Descartes to Riemann, there would be no calculus,</p>
<p>990<br>00:57:50,480 –&gt; 00:57:55,240<br>no quantum physics, no relativity, none of the technology we use today.</p>
<p>991<br>00:57:55,240 –&gt; 00:57:57,440<br>But even more important than that,</p>
<p>992<br>00:57:57,440 –&gt; 00:58:00,800<br>their mathematics blew away the cobwebs</p>
<p>993<br>00:58:00,800 –&gt; 00:58:04,520<br>and allowed us to see the world as it really is -</p>
<p>994<br>00:58:04,520 –&gt; 00:58:07,680<br>a world much stranger than we ever thought.</p>
