<hr>
<p>1<br>00:00:03,400 –&gt; 00:00:07,040<br>Throughout history, humankind has struggled </p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,040 –&gt; 00:00:11,640<br>to understand the fundamental workings of the material world. </p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,640 –&gt; 00:00:16,440<br>We’ve endeavoured to discover the rules and patterns that determine the qualities </p>
<p>4<br>00:00:16,440 –&gt; 00:00:22,080<br>of the objects that surround us, and their complex relationship to us and each other. </p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,360 –&gt; 00:00:28,040<br>Over thousands of years, societies all over the world have found that one discipline </p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,040 –&gt; 00:00:31,560<br>above all others yields certain knowledge </p>
<p>7<br>00:00:31,560 –&gt; 00:00:35,000<br>about the underlying realities of the physical world. </p>
<p>8<br>00:00:35,000 –&gt; 00:00:38,200<br>That discipline is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>. </p>
<p>9<br>00:00:38,200 –&gt; 00:00:41,760<br>I’m <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy">Marcus Du Sautoy</a>, and I’m a mathematician. </p>
<p>10<br>00:00:41,760 –&gt; 00:00:46,440<br>I see myself as a pattern searcher, hunting down the hidden structures </p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,440 –&gt; 00:00:51,480<br>that lie behind the apparent chaos and complexity of the world around us. </p>
<p>12<br>00:00:52,920 –&gt; 00:00:58,200<br>In my search for pattern and order, I draw upon the work of the great mathematicians </p>
<p>13<br>00:00:58,200 –&gt; 00:01:02,480<br>who’ve gone before me, people belonging to cultures across the globe, </p>
<p>14<br>00:01:02,480 –&gt; 00:01:06,920<br>whose innovations created the language the universe is written in. </p>
<p>15<br>00:01:06,920 –&gt; 00:01:12,640<br>I want to take you on a journey through time and space, and track the growth of mathematics </p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,640 –&gt; 00:01:16,920<br>from its awakening to the sophisticated subject we know today. </p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,040 –&gt; 00:01:21,120<br>Using computer generated imagery, we will explore </p>
<p>18<br>00:01:21,120 –&gt; 00:01:24,920<br>the trailblazing discoveries that allowed the earliest civilisations </p>
<p>19<br>00:01:24,920 –&gt; 00:01:28,640<br>to understand the world mathematical. </p>
<p>20<br>00:01:28,640 –&gt; 00:01:31,600<br>This is the story of maths. </p>
<p>21<br>00:01:51,120 –&gt; 00:01:55,080<br>Our world is made up of patterns and sequences. </p>
<p>22<br>00:01:55,080 –&gt; 00:01:57,400<br>They’re all around us. </p>
<p>23<br>00:01:57,400 –&gt; 00:01:59,880<br>Day becomes night. </p>
<p>24<br>00:01:59,880 –&gt; 00:02:04,880<br>Animals travel across the earth in ever-changing formations. </p>
<p>25<br>00:02:04,880 –&gt; 00:02:08,840<br>Landscapes are constantly altering. </p>
<p>26<br>00:02:08,840 –&gt; 00:02:12,680<br>One of the reasons mathematics began was because we needed to find a way </p>
<p>27<br>00:02:12,680 –&gt; 00:02:15,680<br>of making sense of these natural patterns. </p>
<p>28<br>00:02:18,680 –&gt; 00:02:23,200<br>The most basic concepts of maths - space and quantity - </p>
<p>29<br>00:02:23,200 –&gt; 00:02:27,200<br>are hard-wired into our brains. </p>
<p>30<br>00:02:27,200 –&gt; 00:02:30,200<br>Even animals have a sense of distance and number, </p>
<p>31<br>00:02:30,200 –&gt; 00:02:36,120<br>assessing when their pack is outnumbered, and whether to fight or fly, </p>
<p>32<br>00:02:36,120 –&gt; 00:02:40,840<br>calculating whether their prey is within striking distance. </p>
<p>33<br>00:02:40,840 –&gt; 00:02:46,120<br>Understanding maths is the difference between life and death. </p>
<p>34<br>00:02:47,240 –&gt; 00:02:50,160<br>But it was man who took these basic concepts </p>
<p>35<br>00:02:50,160 –&gt; 00:02:52,760<br>and started to build upon these foundations. </p>
<p>36<br>00:02:52,760 –&gt; 00:02:55,880<br>At some point, humans started to spot patterns, </p>
<p>37<br>00:02:55,880 –&gt; 00:02:59,680<br>to make connections, to count and to order the world around them. </p>
<p>38<br>00:02:59,680 –&gt; 00:03:04,720<br>With this, a whole new mathematical universe began to emerge. </p>
<p>39<br>00:03:11,200 –&gt; 00:03:12,960<br>This is the River <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile">Nile</a>. </p>
<p>40<br>00:03:12,960 –&gt; 00:03:15,800<br>It’s been the lifeline of Egypt for millennia. </p>
<p>41<br>00:03:17,200 –&gt; 00:03:20,120<br>I’ve come here because it’s where some of the first signs </p>
<p>42<br>00:03:20,120 –&gt; 00:03:23,560<br>of mathematics as we know it today emerged. </p>
<p>43<br>00:03:25,440 –&gt; 00:03:30,800<br>People abandoned nomadic life and began settling here as early as 6000BC. </p>
<p>44<br>00:03:30,800 –&gt; 00:03:34,880<br>The conditions were perfect for farming. </p>
<p>45<br>00:03:38,160 –&gt; 00:03:44,120<br>The most important event for Egyptian agriculture each year was the flooding of the Nile. </p>
<p>46<br>00:03:44,120 –&gt; 00:03:49,720<br>So this was used as a marker to start each new year. </p>
<p>47<br>00:03:49,720 –&gt; 00:03:54,000<br>Egyptians did record what was going on over periods of time, </p>
<p>48<br>00:03:54,000 –&gt; 00:03:56,480<br>so in order to establish a calendar like this, </p>
<p>49<br>00:03:56,480 –&gt; 00:03:59,960<br>you need to count how many days, for example, </p>
<p>50<br>00:03:59,960 –&gt; 00:04:02,680<br>happened in-between lunar phases, </p>
<p>51<br>00:04:02,680 –&gt; 00:04:08,880<br>or how many days happened in-between two floodings of the Nile. </p>
<p>52<br>00:04:10,440 –&gt; 00:04:14,200<br>Recording the patterns for the seasons was essential, </p>
<p>53<br>00:04:14,200 –&gt; 00:04:18,040<br>not only to their management of the land, but also their religion. </p>
<p>54<br>00:04:18,040 –&gt; 00:04:21,200<br>The ancient Egyptians who settled on the Nile banks </p>
<p>55<br>00:04:21,200 –&gt; 00:04:25,600<br>believed it was the river god, Hapy, who flooded the river each year. </p>
<p>56<br>00:04:25,600 –&gt; 00:04:28,440<br>And in return for the life-giving water, </p>
<p>57<br>00:04:28,440 –&gt; 00:04:32,840<br>the citizens offered a portion of the yield as a thanksgiving. </p>
<p>58<br>00:04:34,040 –&gt; 00:04:38,920<br>As settlements grew larger, it became necessary to find ways to administer them. </p>
<p>59<br>00:04:38,920 –&gt; 00:04:43,200<br>Areas of land needed to be calculated, crop yields predicted, </p>
<p>60<br>00:04:43,200 –&gt; 00:04:45,520<br>taxes charged and collated. </p>
<p>61<br>00:04:45,520 –&gt; 00:04:49,280<br>In short, people needed to count and measure. </p>
<p>62<br>00:04:50,800 –&gt; 00:04:53,800<br>The Egyptians used their bodies to measure the world, </p>
<p>63<br>00:04:53,800 –&gt; 00:04:56,840<br>and it’s how their units of measurements evolved. </p>
<p>64<br>00:04:56,840 –&gt; 00:04:59,240<br>A palm was the width of a hand, </p>
<p>65<br>00:04:59,240 –&gt; 00:05:03,880<br>a cubit an arm length from elbow to fingertips. </p>
<p>66<br>00:05:03,880 –&gt; 00:05:07,320<br>Land cubits, strips of land measuring a cubit by 100, </p>
<p>67<br>00:05:07,320 –&gt; 00:05:10,680<br>were used by the pharaoh’s surveyors to calculate areas. </p>
<p>68<br>00:05:13,880 –&gt; 00:05:17,120<br>There’s a very strong link between bureaucracy </p>
<p>69<br>00:05:17,120 –&gt; 00:05:20,360<br>and the development of mathematics in ancient Egypt. </p>
<p>70<br>00:05:20,360 –&gt; 00:05:23,320<br>And we can see this link right from the beginning, </p>
<p>71<br>00:05:23,320 –&gt; 00:05:25,640<br>from the invention of the number system, </p>
<p>72<br>00:05:25,640 –&gt; 00:05:28,440<br>throughout Egyptian history, really. </p>
<p>73<br>00:05:28,440 –&gt; 00:05:30,920<br>For the Old Kingdom, the only evidence we have </p>
<p>74<br>00:05:30,920 –&gt; 00:05:34,960<br>are metrological systems, that is measurements for areas, for length. </p>
<p>75<br>00:05:34,960 –&gt; 00:05:41,520<br>This points to a bureaucratic need to develop such things. </p>
<p>76<br>00:05:41,520 –&gt; 00:05:46,760<br>It was vital to know the area of a farmer’s land so he could be taxed accordingly. </p>
<p>77<br>00:05:46,760 –&gt; 00:05:51,680<br>Or if the Nile robbed him of part of his land, so he could request a rebate. </p>
<p>78<br>00:05:51,680 –&gt; 00:05:54,640<br>It meant that the pharaoh’s surveyors were often calculating </p>
<p>79<br>00:05:54,640 –&gt; 00:05:58,200<br>the area of irregular parcels of land. </p>
<p>80<br>00:05:58,200 –&gt; 00:06:00,880<br>It was the need to solve such practical problems </p>
<p>81<br>00:06:00,880 –&gt; 00:06:05,080<br>that made them the earliest mathematical innovators. </p>
<p>82<br>00:06:09,760 –&gt; 00:06:13,760<br>The Egyptians needed some way to record the results of their calculations. </p>
<p>83<br>00:06:15,960 –&gt; 00:06:20,560<br>Amongst all the hieroglyphs that cover the tourist souvenirs scattered around Cairo, </p>
<p>84<br>00:06:20,560 –&gt; 00:06:25,760<br>I was on the hunt for those that recorded some of the first numbers in history. </p>
<p>85<br>00:06:25,760 –&gt; 00:06:29,520<br>They were difficult to track down. </p>
<p>86<br>00:06:30,680 –&gt; 00:06:33,480<br>But I did find them in the end. </p>
<p>87<br>00:06:36,560 –&gt; 00:06:41,840<br>The Egyptians were using a decimal system, motivated by the 10 fingers on our hands. </p>
<p>88<br>00:06:41,840 –&gt; 00:06:44,400<br>The sign for one was a stroke, </p>
<p>89<br>00:06:44,400 –&gt; 00:06:50,280<br>10, a heel bone, 100, a coil of rope, and 1,000, a Lotus plant. </p>
<p>90<br>00:06:50,280 –&gt; 00:06:52,560<br>How much is this T-shirt? </p>
<p>91<br>00:06:52,560 –&gt; 00:06:54,280<br>Er, 25. </p>
<p>92<br>00:06:54,280 –&gt; 00:07:00,080</p>
<ul>
<li>25!</li>
<li>Yes!</li>
<li>So that would be 2 knee bones and 5 strokes. </li>
</ul>
<p>93<br>00:07:00,080 –&gt; 00:07:03,440</p>
<ul>
<li>So you’re not gonna charge me anything up here?</li>
<li>Here, one million! </li>
</ul>
<p>94<br>00:07:03,440 –&gt; 00:07:05,480</p>
<ul>
<li>One million?</li>
<li>My God! </li>
</ul>
<p>95<br>00:07:05,480 –&gt; 00:07:07,880<br>This one million. </p>
<p>96<br>00:07:07,880 –&gt; 00:07:09,920<br>One million, yeah, that’s pretty big! </p>
<p>97<br>00:07:11,280 –&gt; 00:07:16,760<br>The hieroglyphs are beautiful, but the Egyptian number system was fundamentally flawed. </p>
<p>98<br>00:07:18,360 –&gt; 00:07:21,880<br>They had no concept of a place value, </p>
<p>99<br>00:07:21,880 –&gt; 00:07:24,360<br>so one stroke could only represent one unit, </p>
<p>100<br>00:07:24,360 –&gt; 00:07:26,080<br>not 100 or 1,000. </p>
<p>101<br>00:07:26,080 –&gt; 00:07:29,120<br>Although you can write a million with just one character, </p>
<p>102<br>00:07:29,120 –&gt; 00:07:33,400<br>rather than the seven that we use, if you want to write a million minus one, </p>
<p>103<br>00:07:33,400 –&gt; 00:07:36,840<br>then the poor old Egyptian scribe has got to write nine strokes, </p>
<p>104<br>00:07:36,840 –&gt; 00:07:40,000<br>nine heel bones, nine coils of rope, and so on, </p>
<p>105<br>00:07:40,000 –&gt; 00:07:42,560<br>a total of 54 characters. </p>
<p>106<br>00:07:44,960 –&gt; 00:07:50,160<br>Despite the drawback of this number system, the Egyptians were brilliant problem solvers. </p>
<p>107<br>00:07:52,160 –&gt; 00:07:56,160<br>We know this because of the few records that have survived. </p>
<p>108<br>00:07:56,160 –&gt; 00:07:59,160<br>The Egyptian scribes used sheets of papyrus </p>
<p>109<br>00:07:59,160 –&gt; 00:08:02,560<br>to record their mathematical discoveries. </p>
<p>110<br>00:08:02,560 –&gt; 00:08:06,360<br>This delicate material made from reeds decayed over time </p>
<p>111<br>00:08:06,360 –&gt; 00:08:09,640<br>and many secrets perished with it. </p>
<p>112<br>00:08:09,640 –&gt; 00:08:13,760<br>But there’s one revealing document that has survived. </p>
<p>113<br>00:08:13,760 –&gt; 00:08:17,600<br>The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is the most important document </p>
<p>114<br>00:08:17,600 –&gt; 00:08:20,400<br>we have today for Egyptian mathematics. </p>
<p>115<br>00:08:20,400 –&gt; 00:08:24,600<br>We get a good overview of what types of problems </p>
<p>116<br>00:08:24,600 –&gt; 00:08:28,560<br>the Egyptians would have dealt with in their mathematics. </p>
<p>117<br>00:08:28,560 –&gt; 00:08:34,040<br>We also get explicitly stated how multiplications and divisions were carried out. </p>
<p>118<br>00:08:35,760 –&gt; 00:08:40,040<br>The papyri show how to multiply two large numbers together. </p>
<p>119<br>00:08:40,040 –&gt; 00:08:44,560<br>But to illustrate the method, let’s take two smaller numbers. </p>
<p>120<br>00:08:44,560 –&gt; 00:08:47,120<br>Let’s do three times six. </p>
<p>121<br>00:08:47,120 –&gt; 00:08:50,720<br>The scribe would take the first number, three, and put it in one column. </p>
<p>122<br>00:08:53,000 –&gt; 00:08:56,200<br>In the second column, he would place the number one. </p>
<p>123<br>00:08:56,200 –&gt; 00:09:00,960<br>Then he would double the numbers in each column, so three becomes six… </p>
<p>124<br>00:09:04,520 –&gt; 00:09:06,600<br>..and six would become 12. </p>
<p>125<br>00:09:11,000 –&gt; 00:09:14,720<br>And then in the second column, one would become two, </p>
<p>126<br>00:09:14,720 –&gt; 00:09:16,280<br>and two becomes four. </p>
<p>127<br>00:09:18,960 –&gt; 00:09:21,400<br>Now, here’s the really clever bit. </p>
<p>128<br>00:09:21,400 –&gt; 00:09:24,400<br>The scribe wants to multiply three by six. </p>
<p>129<br>00:09:24,400 –&gt; 00:09:27,920<br>So he takes the powers of two in the second column, </p>
<p>130<br>00:09:27,920 –&gt; 00:09:31,640<br>which add up to six. That’s two plus four. </p>
<p>131<br>00:09:31,640 –&gt; 00:09:34,560<br>Then he moves back to the first column, and just takes </p>
<p>132<br>00:09:34,560 –&gt; 00:09:37,480<br>those rows corresponding to the two and the four. </p>
<p>133<br>00:09:37,480 –&gt; 00:09:39,120<br>So that’s six and the 12. </p>
<p>134<br>00:09:39,120 –&gt; 00:09:43,960<br>He adds those together to get the answer of 18. </p>
<p>135<br>00:09:43,960 –&gt; 00:09:47,800<br>But for me, the most striking thing about this method </p>
<p>136<br>00:09:47,800 –&gt; 00:09:51,760<br>is that the scribe has effectively written that second number in binary. </p>
<p>137<br>00:09:51,760 –&gt; 00:09:56,760<br>Six is one lot of four, one lot of two, and no units. </p>
<p>138<br>00:09:56,760 –&gt; 00:09:59,360<br>Which is 1-1-0. </p>
<p>139<br>00:09:59,360 –&gt; 00:10:03,640<br>The Egyptians have understood the power of binary over 3,000 years </p>
<p>140<br>00:10:03,640 –&gt; 00:10:07,600<br>before the mathematician and philosopher Leibniz would reveal their potential. </p>
<p>141<br>00:10:07,600 –&gt; 00:10:11,920<br>Today, the whole technological world depends on the same principles </p>
<p>142<br>00:10:11,920 –&gt; 00:10:14,800<br>that were used in ancient Egypt. </p>
<p>143<br>00:10:16,600 –&gt; 00:10:22,200<br>The Rhind Papyrus was recorded by a scribe called Ahmes around 1650BC. </p>
<p>144<br>00:10:22,200 –&gt; 00:10:27,080<br>Its problems are concerned with finding solutions to everyday situations. </p>
<p>145<br>00:10:27,080 –&gt; 00:10:30,200<br>Several of the problems mention bread and beer, </p>
<p>146<br>00:10:30,200 –&gt; 00:10:33,960<br>which isn’t surprising as Egyptian workers were paid in food and drink. </p>
<p>147<br>00:10:33,960 –&gt; 00:10:37,400<br>One is concerned with how to divide nine loaves </p>
<p>148<br>00:10:37,400 –&gt; 00:10:41,880<br>equally between 10 people, without a fight breaking out. </p>
<p>149<br>00:10:41,880 –&gt; 00:10:44,000<br>I’ve got nine loaves of bread here. </p>
<p>150<br>00:10:44,000 –&gt; 00:10:47,800<br>I’m gonna take five of them and cut them into halves. </p>
<p>151<br>00:10:48,840 –&gt; 00:10:51,560<br>Of course, nine people could shave a 10th off their loaf </p>
<p>152<br>00:10:51,560 –&gt; 00:10:54,960<br>and give the pile of crumbs to the 10th person. </p>
<p>153<br>00:10:54,960 –&gt; 00:10:58,800<br>But the Egyptians developed a far more elegant solution - </p>
<p>154<br>00:10:58,800 –&gt; 00:11:02,480<br>take the next four and divide those into thirds. </p>
<p>155<br>00:11:04,040 –&gt; 00:11:07,560<br>But two of the thirds I am now going to cut into fifths, </p>
<p>156<br>00:11:07,560 –&gt; 00:11:10,000<br>so each piece will be one fifteenth. </p>
<p>157<br>00:11:12,760 –&gt; 00:11:17,240<br>Each person then gets one half </p>
<p>158<br>00:11:17,240 –&gt; 00:11:19,360<br>and one third </p>
<p>159<br>00:11:19,360 –&gt; 00:11:23,080<br>and one fifteenth. </p>
<p>160<br>00:11:23,080 –&gt; 00:11:26,000<br>It is through such seemingly practical problems </p>
<p>161<br>00:11:26,000 –&gt; 00:11:29,560<br>that we start to see a more abstract mathematics developing. </p>
<p>162<br>00:11:29,560 –&gt; 00:11:32,280<br>Suddenly, new numbers are on the scene - fractions - </p>
<p>163<br>00:11:32,280 –&gt; 00:11:37,680<br>and it isn’t too long before the Egyptians are exploring the mathematics of these numbers. </p>
<p>164<br>00:11:39,640 –&gt; 00:11:45,080<br>Fractions are clearly of practical importance to anyone dividing quantities for trade in the market. </p>
<p>165<br>00:11:45,080 –&gt; 00:11:51,880<br>To log these transactions, the Egyptians developed notation which recorded these new numbers. </p>
<p>166<br>00:11:53,400 –&gt; 00:11:56,560<br>One of the earliest representations of these fractions </p>
<p>167<br>00:11:56,560 –&gt; 00:12:00,240<br>came from a hieroglyph which had great mystical significance. </p>
<p>168<br>00:12:00,240 –&gt; 00:12:03,880<br>It’s called the Eye of Horus. </p>
<p>169<br>00:12:03,880 –&gt; 00:12:09,000<br>Horus was an Old Kingdom god, depicted as half man, half falcon. </p>
<p>170<br>00:12:10,920 –&gt; 00:12:15,760<br>According to legend, Horus’ father was killed by his other son, Seth. </p>
<p>171<br>00:12:15,760 –&gt; 00:12:18,960<br>Horus was determined to avenge the murder. </p>
<p>172<br>00:12:18,960 –&gt; 00:12:21,640<br>During one particularly fierce battle, </p>
<p>173<br>00:12:21,640 –&gt; 00:12:26,600<br>Seth ripped out Horus’ eye, tore it up and scattered it over Egypt. </p>
<p>174<br>00:12:26,600 –&gt; 00:12:29,800<br>But the gods were looking favourably on Horus. </p>
<p>175<br>00:12:29,800 –&gt; 00:12:33,520<br>They gathered up the scattered pieces and reassembled the eye. </p>
<p>176<br>00:12:36,520 –&gt; 00:12:40,360<br>Each part of the eye represented a different fraction. </p>
<p>177<br>00:12:40,360 –&gt; 00:12:43,280<br>Each one, half the fraction before. </p>
<p>178<br>00:12:43,280 –&gt; 00:12:46,880<br>Although the original eye represented a whole unit, </p>
<p>179<br>00:12:46,880 –&gt; 00:12:50,680<br>the reassembled eye is 1/64 short. </p>
<p>180<br>00:12:50,680 –&gt; 00:12:54,720<br>Although the Egyptians stopped at 1/64, </p>
<p>181<br>00:12:54,720 –&gt; 00:12:56,800<br>implicit in this picture </p>
<p>182<br>00:12:56,800 –&gt; 00:12:59,520<br>is the possibility of adding more fractions, </p>
<p>183<br>00:12:59,520 –&gt; 00:13:04,000<br>halving them each time, the sum getting closer and closer to one, </p>
<p>184<br>00:13:04,000 –&gt; 00:13:07,200<br>but never quite reaching it. </p>
<p>185<br>00:13:07,200 –&gt; 00:13:11,120<br>This is the first hint of something called a geometric series, </p>
<p>186<br>00:13:11,120 –&gt; 00:13:14,640<br>and it appears at a number of points in the Rhind Papyrus. </p>
<p>187<br>00:13:14,640 –&gt; 00:13:17,640<br>But the concept of infinite series would remain hidden </p>
<p>188<br>00:13:17,640 –&gt; 00:13:21,840<br>until the mathematicians of Asia discovered it centuries later. </p>
<p>189<br>00:13:24,920 –&gt; 00:13:29,080<br>Having worked out a system of numbers, including these new fractions, </p>
<p>190<br>00:13:29,080 –&gt; 00:13:31,960<br>it was time for the Egyptians to apply their knowledge </p>
<p>191<br>00:13:31,960 –&gt; 00:13:35,600<br>to understanding shapes that they encountered day to day. </p>
<p>192<br>00:13:35,600 –&gt; 00:13:39,640<br>These shapes were rarely regular squares or rectangles, </p>
<p>193<br>00:13:39,640 –&gt; 00:13:44,400<br>and in the Rhind Papyrus, we find the area of a more organic form, the circle. </p>
<p>194<br>00:13:44,400 –&gt; 00:13:48,720<br>What is astounding in the calculation </p>
<p>195<br>00:13:48,720 –&gt; 00:13:51,680<br>of the area of the circle is its exactness, really. </p>
<p>196<br>00:13:51,680 –&gt; 00:13:55,600<br>How they would have found their method is open to speculation, </p>
<p>197<br>00:13:55,600 –&gt; 00:13:57,680<br>because the texts we have </p>
<p>198<br>00:13:57,680 –&gt; 00:14:01,280<br>do not show us the methods how they were found. </p>
<p>199<br>00:14:01,280 –&gt; 00:14:05,360<br>This calculation is particularly striking because it depends </p>
<p>200<br>00:14:05,360 –&gt; 00:14:07,320<br>on seeing how the shape of the circle </p>
<p>201<br>00:14:07,320 –&gt; 00:14:12,040<br>can be approximated by shapes that the Egyptians already understood. </p>
<p>202<br>00:14:12,040 –&gt; 00:14:15,160<br>The Rhind Papyrus states that a circular field </p>
<p>203<br>00:14:15,160 –&gt; 00:14:17,720<br>with a diameter of nine units </p>
<p>204<br>00:14:17,720 –&gt; 00:14:21,200<br>is close in area to a square with sides of eight. </p>
<p>205<br>00:14:21,200 –&gt; 00:14:25,000<br>But how would this relationship have been discovered? </p>
<p>206<br>00:14:25,000 –&gt; 00:14:30,400<br>My favourite theory sees the answer in the ancient game of mancala. </p>
<p>207<br>00:14:30,400 –&gt; 00:14:34,560<br>Mancala boards were found carved on the roofs of temples. </p>
<p>208<br>00:14:34,560 –&gt; 00:14:38,120<br>Each player starts with an equal number of stones, </p>
<p>209<br>00:14:38,120 –&gt; 00:14:41,160<br>and the object of the game is to move them round the board, </p>
<p>210<br>00:14:41,160 –&gt; 00:14:44,280<br>capturing your opponent’s counters on the way. </p>
<p>211<br>00:14:45,240 –&gt; 00:14:49,080<br>As the players sat around waiting to make their next move, </p>
<p>212<br>00:14:49,080 –&gt; 00:14:52,600<br>perhaps one of them realised that sometimes the balls fill the circular holes </p>
<p>213<br>00:14:52,600 –&gt; 00:14:54,800<br>of the mancala board in a rather nice way. </p>
<p>214<br>00:14:54,800 –&gt; 00:14:59,920<br>He might have gone on to experiment with trying to make larger circles. </p>
<p>215<br>00:14:59,920 –&gt; 00:15:04,480<br>Perhaps he noticed that 64 stones, the square of 8, </p>
<p>216<br>00:15:04,480 –&gt; 00:15:08,280<br>can be used to make a circle with diameter nine stones. </p>
<p>217<br>00:15:08,280 –&gt; 00:15:13,800<br>By rearranging the stones, the circle has been approximated by a square. </p>
<p>218<br>00:15:13,800 –&gt; 00:15:16,960<br>And because the area of a circle is pi times the radius squared, </p>
<p>219<br>00:15:16,960 –&gt; 00:15:21,840<br>the Egyptian calculation gives us the first accurate value for pi. </p>
<p>220<br>00:15:21,840 –&gt; 00:15:26,840<br>The area of the circle is 64. Divide this by the radius squared, </p>
<p>221<br>00:15:26,840 –&gt; 00:15:30,880<br>in this case 4.5 squared, and you get a value for pi. </p>
<p>222<br>00:15:30,880 –&gt; 00:15:35,640<br>So 64 divided by 4.5 squared is 3.16, </p>
<p>223<br>00:15:35,640 –&gt; 00:15:38,960<br>just a little under two hundredths away from its true value. </p>
<p>224<br>00:15:38,960 –&gt; 00:15:42,120<br>But the really brilliant thing is, the Egyptians </p>
<p>225<br>00:15:42,120 –&gt; 00:15:45,320<br>are using these smaller shapes to capture the larger shape. </p>
<p>226<br>00:15:49,920 –&gt; 00:15:52,920<br>But there’s one imposing and majestic symbol of Egyptian </p>
<p>227<br>00:15:52,920 –&gt; 00:15:55,920<br>mathematics we haven’t attempted to unravel yet - </p>
<p>228<br>00:15:55,920 –&gt; 00:15:58,160<br>the pyramid. </p>
<p>229<br>00:15:58,160 –&gt; 00:16:03,040<br>I’ve seen so many pictures that I couldn’t believe I’d be impressed by them. </p>
<p>230<br>00:16:03,040 –&gt; 00:16:06,560<br>But meeting them face to face, you understand why they’re called </p>
<p>231<br>00:16:06,560 –&gt; 00:16:09,040<br>one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. </p>
<p>232<br>00:16:09,040 –&gt; 00:16:11,280<br>They’re simply breathtaking. </p>
<p>233<br>00:16:11,280 –&gt; 00:16:14,600<br>And how much more impressive they must have been in their day, </p>
<p>234<br>00:16:14,600 –&gt; 00:16:19,640<br>when the sides were as smooth as glass, reflecting the desert sun. </p>
<p>235<br>00:16:19,640 –&gt; 00:16:25,200<br>To me it looks like there might be mirror pyramids hiding underneath the desert, </p>
<p>236<br>00:16:25,200 –&gt; 00:16:29,480<br>which would complete the shapes to make perfectly symmetrical octahedrons. </p>
<p>237<br>00:16:29,480 –&gt; 00:16:34,840<br>Sometimes, in the shimmer of the desert heat, you can almost see these shapes. </p>
<p>238<br>00:16:36,360 –&gt; 00:16:43,680<br>It’s the hint of symmetry hidden inside these shapes that makes them so impressive for a mathematician. </p>
<p>239<br>00:16:43,680 –&gt; 00:16:47,960<br>The pyramids are just a little short to create these perfect shapes, </p>
<p>240<br>00:16:47,960 –&gt; 00:16:51,160<br>but some have suggested another important mathematical concept </p>
<p>241<br>00:16:51,160 –&gt; 00:16:57,120<br>might be hidden inside the proportions of the Great Pyramid - the golden ratio. </p>
<p>242<br>00:16:57,120 –&gt; 00:17:01,880<br>Two lengths are in the golden ratio, if the relationship of the longest </p>
<p>243<br>00:17:01,880 –&gt; 00:17:07,160<br>to the shortest is the same as the sum of the two to the longest side. </p>
<p>244<br>00:17:07,160 –&gt; 00:17:11,840<br>Such a ratio has been associated with the perfect proportions one finds </p>
<p>245<br>00:17:11,840 –&gt; 00:17:15,840<br>all over the natural world, as well as in the work of artists, </p>
<p>246<br>00:17:15,840 –&gt; 00:17:18,720<br>architects and designers for millennia. </p>
<p>247<br>00:17:22,560 –&gt; 00:17:27,000<br>Whether the architects of the pyramids were conscious of this important mathematical idea, </p>
<p>248<br>00:17:27,000 –&gt; 00:17:32,680<br>or were instinctively drawn to it because of its satisfying aesthetic properties, we’ll never know. </p>
<p>249<br>00:17:32,680 –&gt; 00:17:37,040<br>For me, the most impressive thing about the pyramids is the mathematical brilliance </p>
<p>250<br>00:17:37,040 –&gt; 00:17:40,600<br>that went into making them, including the first inkling </p>
<p>251<br>00:17:40,600 –&gt; 00:17:44,640<br>of one of the great theorems of the ancient world, Pythagoras’ theorem. </p>
<p>252<br>00:17:46,160 –&gt; 00:17:49,160<br>In order to get perfect right-angled corners on their buildings </p>
<p>253<br>00:17:49,160 –&gt; 00:17:54,320<br>and pyramids, the Egyptians would have used a rope with knots tied in it. </p>
<p>254<br>00:17:54,320 –&gt; 00:17:58,200<br>At some point, the Egyptians realised that if they took a triangle with sides </p>
<p>255<br>00:17:58,200 –&gt; 00:18:05,640<br>marked with three knots, four knots and five knots, it guaranteed them a perfect right-angle. </p>
<p>256<br>00:18:05,640 –&gt; 00:18:10,120<br>This is because three squared, plus four squared, is equal to five squared. </p>
<p>257<br>00:18:10,120 –&gt; 00:18:12,840<br>So we’ve got a perfect Pythagorean triangle. </p>
<p>258<br>00:18:15,160 –&gt; 00:18:20,960<br>In fact any triangle whose sides satisfy this relationship will give me an 90-degree angle. </p>
<p>259<br>00:18:20,960 –&gt; 00:18:23,600<br>But I’m pretty sure that the Egyptians hadn’t got </p>
<p>260<br>00:18:23,600 –&gt; 00:18:28,480<br>this sweeping generalisation of their 3, 4, 5 triangle. </p>
<p>261<br>00:18:28,480 –&gt; 00:18:32,240<br>We would not expect to find the general proof </p>
<p>262<br>00:18:32,240 –&gt; 00:18:35,720<br>because this is not the style of Egyptian mathematics. </p>
<p>263<br>00:18:35,720 –&gt; 00:18:39,320<br>Every problem was solved using concrete numbers and then </p>
<p>264<br>00:18:39,320 –&gt; 00:18:43,760<br>if a verification would be carried out at the end, it would use the result </p>
<p>265<br>00:18:43,760 –&gt; 00:18:45,720<br>and these concrete, given numbers, </p>
<p>266<br>00:18:45,720 –&gt; 00:18:49,440<br>there’s no general proof within the Egyptian mathematical texts. </p>
<p>267<br>00:18:50,960 –&gt; 00:18:54,080<br>It would be some 2,000 years before the Greeks and Pythagoras </p>
<p>268<br>00:18:54,080 –&gt; 00:18:59,280<br>would prove that all right-angled triangles shared certain properties. </p>
<p>269<br>00:18:59,280 –&gt; 00:19:03,640<br>This wasn’t the only mathematical idea that the Egyptians would anticipate. </p>
<p>270<br>00:19:03,640 –&gt; 00:19:10,160<br>In a 4,000-year-old document called the Moscow papyrus, we find a formula for the volume </p>
<p>271<br>00:19:10,160 –&gt; 00:19:16,120<br>of a pyramid with its peak sliced off, which shows the first hint of calculus at work. </p>
<p>272<br>00:19:16,120 –&gt; 00:19:22,920<br>For a culture like Egypt that is famous for its pyramids, you would expect problems like this </p>
<p>273<br>00:19:22,920 –&gt; 00:19:26,560<br>to have been a regular feature within the mathematical texts. </p>
<p>274<br>00:19:26,560 –&gt; 00:19:31,280<br>The calculation of the volume of a truncated pyramid is one of the most </p>
<p>275<br>00:19:31,280 –&gt; 00:19:36,480<br>advanced bits, according to our modern standards of mathematics, </p>
<p>276<br>00:19:36,480 –&gt; 00:19:39,080<br>that we have from ancient Egypt. </p>
<p>277<br>00:19:39,080 –&gt; 00:19:43,120<br>The architects and engineers would certainly have wanted such a formula </p>
<p>278<br>00:19:43,120 –&gt; 00:19:46,760<br>to calculate the amount of materials required to build it. </p>
<p>279<br>00:19:46,760 –&gt; 00:19:49,000<br>But it’s a mark of the sophistication </p>
<p>280<br>00:19:49,000 –&gt; 00:19:53,760<br>of Egyptian mathematics that they were able to produce such a beautiful method. </p>
<p>281<br>00:19:59,760 –&gt; 00:20:03,760<br>To understand how they derived their formula, start with a pyramid </p>
<p>282<br>00:20:03,760 –&gt; 00:20:08,480<br>built such that the highest point sits directly over one corner. </p>
<p>283<br>00:20:08,480 –&gt; 00:20:13,080<br>Three of these can be put together to make a rectangular box, </p>
<p>284<br>00:20:13,080 –&gt; 00:20:18,240<br>so the volume of the skewed pyramid is a third the volume of the box. </p>
<p>285<br>00:20:18,240 –&gt; 00:20:24,280<br>That is, the height, times the length, times the width, divided by three. </p>
<p>286<br>00:20:24,280 –&gt; 00:20:29,320<br>Now comes an argument which shows the very first hints of the calculus at work, </p>
<p>287<br>00:20:29,320 –&gt; 00:20:35,320<br>thousands of years before Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton would come up with the theory. </p>
<p>288<br>00:20:35,320 –&gt; 00:20:39,640<br>Suppose you could cut the pyramid into slices, you could then slide </p>
<p>289<br>00:20:39,640 –&gt; 00:20:44,960<br>the layers across to make the more symmetrical pyramid you see in Giza. </p>
<p>290<br>00:20:44,960 –&gt; 00:20:49,720<br>However, the volume of the pyramid has not changed, despite the rearrangement of the layers. </p>
<p>291<br>00:20:49,720 –&gt; 00:20:52,120<br>So the same formula works. </p>
<p>292<br>00:20:55,360 –&gt; 00:20:58,880<br>The Egyptians were amazing innovators, </p>
<p>293<br>00:20:58,880 –&gt; 00:21:02,080<br>and their ability to generate new mathematics was staggering. </p>
<p>294<br>00:21:02,080 –&gt; 00:21:07,320<br>For me, they revealed the power of geometry and numbers, and made the first moves </p>
<p>295<br>00:21:07,320 –&gt; 00:21:11,760<br>towards some of the exciting mathematical discoveries to come. </p>
<p>296<br>00:21:11,760 –&gt; 00:21:15,960<br>But there was another civilisation that had mathematics to rival that of Egypt. </p>
<p>297<br>00:21:15,960 –&gt; 00:21:20,040<br>And we know much more about their achievements. </p>
<p>298<br>00:21:24,280 –&gt; 00:21:27,880<br>This is Damascus, over 5,000 years old, </p>
<p>299<br>00:21:27,880 –&gt; 00:21:31,280<br>and still vibrant and bustling today. </p>
<p>300<br>00:21:31,280 –&gt; 00:21:36,840<br>It used to be the most important point on the trade routes, linking old Mesopotamia with Egypt. </p>
<p>301<br>00:21:36,840 –&gt; 00:21:43,720<br>The Babylonians controlled much of modern-day Iraq, Iran and Syria, from 1800BC. </p>
<p>302<br>00:21:43,720 –&gt; 00:21:51,120<br>In order to expand and run their empire, they became masters of managing and manipulating numbers. </p>
<p>303<br>00:21:51,120 –&gt; 00:21:53,920<br>We have law codes for instance that tell us </p>
<p>304<br>00:21:53,920 –&gt; 00:21:56,200<br>about the way society is ordered. </p>
<p>305<br>00:21:56,200 –&gt; 00:22:00,120<br>The people we know most about are the scribes, the professionally literate </p>
<p>306<br>00:22:00,120 –&gt; 00:22:05,280<br>and numerate people who kept the records for the wealthy families and for the temples and palaces. </p>
<p>307<br>00:22:05,280 –&gt; 00:22:10,320<br>Scribe schools existed from around 2500BC. </p>
<p>308<br>00:22:10,320 –&gt; 00:22:17,240<br>Aspiring scribes were sent there as children, and learned how to read, write and work with numbers. </p>
<p>309<br>00:22:17,240 –&gt; 00:22:20,120<br>Scribe records were kept on clay tablets, </p>
<p>310<br>00:22:20,120 –&gt; 00:22:24,200<br>which allowed the Babylonians to manage and advance their empire. </p>
<p>311<br>00:22:24,200 –&gt; 00:22:31,000<br>However, many of the tablets we have today aren’t official documents, but children’s exercises. </p>
<p>312<br>00:22:31,000 –&gt; 00:22:37,640<br>It’s these unlikely relics that give us a rare insight into how the Babylonians approached mathematics. </p>
<p>313<br>00:22:37,640 –&gt; 00:22:42,440<br>So, this is a geometrical textbook from about the 18th century BC. </p>
<p>314<br>00:22:42,440 –&gt; 00:22:44,920<br>I hope you can see that there are lots of pictures on it. </p>
<p>315<br>00:22:44,920 –&gt; 00:22:49,160<br>And underneath each picture is a text that sets a problem about the picture. </p>
<p>316<br>00:22:49,160 –&gt; 00:22:55,800<br>So for instance this one here says, I drew a square, 60 units long, </p>
<p>317<br>00:22:55,800 –&gt; 00:23:01,200<br>and inside it, I drew four circles - what are their areas? </p>
<p>318<br>00:23:01,200 –&gt; 00:23:07,240<br>This little tablet here was written 1,000 years at least later than the tablet here, </p>
<p>319<br>00:23:07,240 –&gt; 00:23:10,120<br>but has a very interesting relationship. </p>
<p>320<br>00:23:10,120 –&gt; 00:23:12,520<br>It also has four circles on, </p>
<p>321<br>00:23:12,520 –&gt; 00:23:17,280<br>in a square, roughly drawn, but this isn’t a textbook, it’s a school exercise. </p>
<p>322<br>00:23:17,280 –&gt; 00:23:21,400<br>The adult scribe who’s teaching the student is being given this </p>
<p>323<br>00:23:21,400 –&gt; 00:23:25,320<br>as an example of completed homework or something like that. </p>
<p>324<br>00:23:26,440 –&gt; 00:23:29,560<br>Like the Egyptians, the Babylonians appeared interested </p>
<p>325<br>00:23:29,560 –&gt; 00:23:32,920<br>in solving practical problems to do with measuring and weighing. </p>
<p>326<br>00:23:32,920 –&gt; 00:23:37,400<br>The Babylonian solutions to these problems are written like mathematical recipes. </p>
<p>327<br>00:23:37,400 –&gt; 00:23:43,000<br>A scribe would simply follow and record a set of instructions to get a result. </p>
<p>328<br>00:23:43,000 –&gt; 00:23:47,760<br>Here’s an example of the kind of problem they’d solve. </p>
<p>329<br>00:23:47,760 –&gt; 00:23:51,760<br>I’ve got a bundle of cinnamon sticks here, but I’m not gonna weigh them. </p>
<p>330<br>00:23:51,760 –&gt; 00:23:56,440<br>Instead, I’m gonna take four times their weight and add them to the scales. </p>
<p>331<br>00:23:58,040 –&gt; 00:24:04,640<br>Now I’m gonna add 20 gin. Gin was the ancient Babylonian measure of weight. </p>
<p>332<br>00:24:04,640 –&gt; 00:24:07,960<br>I’m gonna take half of everything here and then add it again… </p>
<p>333<br>00:24:07,960 –&gt; 00:24:10,280<br>That’s two bundles, and ten gin. </p>
<p>334<br>00:24:10,280 –&gt; 00:24:16,320<br>Everything on this side is equal to one mana. One mana was 60 gin. </p>
<p>335<br>00:24:16,320 –&gt; 00:24:20,280<br>And here, we have one of the first mathematical equations in history, </p>
<p>336<br>00:24:20,280 –&gt; 00:24:23,160<br>everything on this side is equal to one mana. </p>
<p>337<br>00:24:23,160 –&gt; 00:24:26,200<br>But how much does the bundle of cinnamon sticks weigh? </p>
<p>338<br>00:24:26,200 –&gt; 00:24:29,480<br>Without any algebraic language, they were able to manipulate </p>
<p>339<br>00:24:29,480 –&gt; 00:24:35,200<br>the quantities to be able to prove that the cinnamon sticks weighed five gin. </p>
<p>340<br>00:24:35,200 –&gt; 00:24:40,560<br>In my mind, it’s this kind of problem which gives mathematics a bit of a bad name. </p>
<p>341<br>00:24:40,560 –&gt; 00:24:45,040<br>You can blame those ancient Babylonians for all those tortuous problems you had at school. </p>
<p>342<br>00:24:45,040 –&gt; 00:24:50,200<br>But the ancient Babylonian scribes excelled at this kind of problem. </p>
<p>343<br>00:24:50,200 –&gt; 00:24:57,440<br>Intriguingly, they weren’t using powers of 10, like the Egyptians, they were using powers of 60. </p>
<p>344<br>00:25:00,120 –&gt; 00:25:05,320<br>The Babylonians invented their number system, like the Egyptians, by using their fingers. </p>
<p>345<br>00:25:05,320 –&gt; 00:25:08,520<br>But instead of counting through the 10 fingers on their hand, </p>
<p>346<br>00:25:08,520 –&gt; 00:25:11,480<br>Babylonians found a more intriguing way to count body parts. </p>
<p>347<br>00:25:11,480 –&gt; 00:25:14,000<br>They used the 12 knuckles on one hand, </p>
<p>348<br>00:25:14,000 –&gt; 00:25:16,400<br>and the five fingers on the other to be able to count </p>
<p>349<br>00:25:16,400 –&gt; 00:25:20,520<br>12 times 5, ie 60 different numbers. </p>
<p>350<br>00:25:20,520 –&gt; 00:25:25,000<br>So for example, this number would have been 2 lots of 12, 24, </p>
<p>351<br>00:25:25,000 –&gt; 00:25:29,120<br>and then, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, to make 29. </p>
<p>352<br>00:25:32,200 –&gt; 00:25:35,920<br>The number 60 had another powerful property. </p>
<p>353<br>00:25:35,920 –&gt; 00:25:39,360<br>It can be perfectly divided in a multitude of ways. </p>
<p>354<br>00:25:39,360 –&gt; 00:25:41,360<br>Here are 60 beans. </p>
<p>355<br>00:25:41,360 –&gt; 00:25:44,800<br>I can arrange them in 2 rows of 30. </p>
<p>356<br>00:25:48,760 –&gt; 00:25:51,520<br>3 rows of 20. </p>
<p>357<br>00:25:51,520 –&gt; 00:25:53,920<br>4 rows of 15. </p>
<p>358<br>00:25:53,920 –&gt; 00:25:56,160<br>5 rows of 12. </p>
<p>359<br>00:25:56,160 –&gt; 00:25:59,320<br>Or 6 rows of 10. </p>
<p>360<br>00:25:59,320 –&gt; 00:26:04,560<br>The divisibility of 60 makes it a perfect base in which to do arithmetic. </p>
<p>361<br>00:26:04,560 –&gt; 00:26:11,000<br>The base 60 system was so successful, we still use elements of it today. </p>
<p>362<br>00:26:11,000 –&gt; 00:26:15,080<br>Every time we want to tell the time, we recognise units of 60 - </p>
<p>363<br>00:26:15,080 –&gt; 00:26:19,040<br>60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour. </p>
<p>364<br>00:26:19,040 –&gt; 00:26:24,800<br>But the most important feature of the Babylonians’ number system was that it recognised place value. </p>
<p>365<br>00:26:24,800 –&gt; 00:26:30,200<br>Just as our decimal numbers count how many lots of tens, hundreds and thousands you’re recording, </p>
<p>366<br>00:26:30,200 –&gt; 00:26:34,320<br>the position of each Babylonian number records the power of 60. </p>
<p>367<br>00:26:41,360 –&gt; 00:26:44,440<br>Instead of inventing new symbols for bigger and bigger numbers, </p>
<p>368<br>00:26:44,440 –&gt; 00:26:50,440<br>they would write 1-1-1, so this number would be 3,661. </p>
<p>369<br>00:26:54,000 –&gt; 00:26:59,680<br>The catalyst for this discovery was the Babylonians’ desire to chart the course of the night sky. </p>
<p>370<br>00:27:07,400 –&gt; 00:27:10,840<br>The Babylonians’ calendar was based on the cycles of the moon. </p>
<p>371<br>00:27:10,840 –&gt; 00:27:15,200<br>They needed a way of recording astronomically large numbers. </p>
<p>372<br>00:27:15,200 –&gt; 00:27:19,560<br>Month by month, year by year, these cycles were recorded. </p>
<p>373<br>00:27:19,560 –&gt; 00:27:25,720<br>From about 800BC, there were complete lists of lunar eclipses. </p>
<p>374<br>00:27:25,720 –&gt; 00:27:30,480<br>The Babylonian system of measurement was quite sophisticated at that time. </p>
<p>375<br>00:27:30,480 –&gt; 00:27:32,840<br>They had a system of angular measurement, </p>
<p>376<br>00:27:32,840 –&gt; 00:27:36,960<br>360 degrees in a full circle, each degree was divided </p>
<p>377<br>00:27:36,960 –&gt; 00:27:41,920<br>into 60 minutes, a minute was further divided into 60 seconds. </p>
<p>378<br>00:27:41,920 –&gt; 00:27:48,560<br>So they had a regular system for measurement, and it was in perfect harmony with their number system, </p>
<p>379<br>00:27:48,560 –&gt; 00:27:52,200<br>so it’s well suited not only for observation but also for calculation. </p>
<p>380<br>00:27:52,200 –&gt; 00:27:56,360<br>But in order to calculate and cope with these large numbers, </p>
<p>381<br>00:27:56,360 –&gt; 00:28:00,720<br>the Babylonians needed to invent a new symbol. </p>
<p>382<br>00:28:00,720 –&gt; 00:28:03,760<br>And in so doing, they prepared the ground for one of the great </p>
<p>383<br>00:28:03,760 –&gt; 00:28:06,880<br>breakthroughs in the history of mathematics - zero. </p>
<p>384<br>00:28:06,880 –&gt; 00:28:11,240<br>In the early days, the Babylonians, in order to mark an empty place in </p>
<p>385<br>00:28:11,240 –&gt; 00:28:14,640<br>the middle of a number, would simply leave a blank space. </p>
<p>386<br>00:28:14,640 –&gt; 00:28:19,960<br>So they needed a way of representing nothing in the middle of a number. </p>
<p>387<br>00:28:19,960 –&gt; 00:28:25,360<br>So they used a sign, as a sort of breathing marker, a punctuation mark, </p>
<p>388<br>00:28:25,360 –&gt; 00:28:28,480<br>and it comes to mean zero in the middle of a number. </p>
<p>389<br>00:28:28,480 –&gt; 00:28:31,680<br>This was the first time zero, in any form, </p>
<p>390<br>00:28:31,680 –&gt; 00:28:35,440<br>had appeared in the mathematical universe. </p>
<p>391<br>00:28:35,440 –&gt; 00:28:42,000<br>But it would be over a 1,000 years before this little place holder would become a number in its own right. </p>
<p>392<br>00:28:50,600 –&gt; 00:28:53,920<br>Having established such a sophisticated system of numbers, </p>
<p>393<br>00:28:53,920 –&gt; 00:28:59,720<br>they harnessed it to tame the arid and inhospitable land that ran through Mesopotamia. </p>
<p>394<br>00:29:02,080 –&gt; 00:29:06,400<br>Babylonian engineers and surveyors found ingenious ways of </p>
<p>395<br>00:29:06,400 –&gt; 00:29:10,400<br>accessing water, and channelling it to the crop fields. </p>
<p>396<br>00:29:10,400 –&gt; 00:29:15,760<br>Yet again, they used mathematics to come up with solutions. </p>
<p>397<br>00:29:15,760 –&gt; 00:29:19,200<br>The Orontes valley in Syria is still an agricultural hub, </p>
<p>398<br>00:29:19,200 –&gt; 00:29:26,320<br>and the old methods of irrigation are being exploited today, just as they were thousands of years ago. </p>
<p>399<br>00:29:26,320 –&gt; 00:29:29,160<br>Many of the problems in Babylonian mathematics </p>
<p>400<br>00:29:29,160 –&gt; 00:29:34,360<br>are concerned with measuring land, and it’s here we see for the first time </p>
<p>401<br>00:29:34,360 –&gt; 00:29:39,920<br>the use of quadratic equations, one of the greatest legacies of Babylonian mathematics. </p>
<p>402<br>00:29:39,920 –&gt; 00:29:43,560<br>Quadratic equations involve things where the unknown quantity </p>
<p>403<br>00:29:43,560 –&gt; 00:29:46,920<br>you’re trying to identify is multiplied by itself. </p>
<p>404<br>00:29:46,920 –&gt; 00:29:49,880<br>We call this squaring because it gives the area of a square, </p>
<p>405<br>00:29:49,880 –&gt; 00:29:53,040<br>and it’s in the context of calculating the area of land </p>
<p>406<br>00:29:53,040 –&gt; 00:29:55,960<br>that these quadratic equations naturally arise. </p>
<p>407<br>00:30:01,320 –&gt; 00:30:03,280<br>Here’s a typical problem. </p>
<p>408<br>00:30:03,280 –&gt; 00:30:06,160<br>If a field has an area of 55 units </p>
<p>409<br>00:30:06,160 –&gt; 00:30:10,640<br>and one side is six units longer than the other, </p>
<p>410<br>00:30:10,640 –&gt; 00:30:12,560<br>how long is the shorter side? </p>
<p>411<br>00:30:14,200 –&gt; 00:30:18,640<br>The Babylonian solution was to reconfigure the field as a square. </p>
<p>412<br>00:30:18,640 –&gt; 00:30:21,920<br>Cut three units off the end </p>
<p>413<br>00:30:21,920 –&gt; 00:30:24,760<br>and move this round. </p>
<p>414<br>00:30:24,760 –&gt; 00:30:29,920<br>Now, there’s a three-by-three piece missing, so let’s add this in. </p>
<p>415<br>00:30:29,920 –&gt; 00:30:34,640<br>The area of the field has increased by nine units. </p>
<p>416<br>00:30:34,640 –&gt; 00:30:38,040<br>This makes the new area 64. </p>
<p>417<br>00:30:38,040 –&gt; 00:30:41,880<br>So the sides of the square are eight units. </p>
<p>418<br>00:30:41,880 –&gt; 00:30:45,320<br>The problem-solver knows that they’ve added three to this side. </p>
<p>419<br>00:30:45,320 –&gt; 00:30:49,520<br>So, the original length must be five. </p>
<p>420<br>00:30:50,520 –&gt; 00:30:55,600<br>It may not look like it, but this is one of the first quadratic equations in history. </p>
<p>421<br>00:30:57,400 –&gt; 00:31:02,400<br>In modern mathematics, I would use the symbolic language of algebra to solve this problem. </p>
<p>422<br>00:31:02,400 –&gt; 00:31:07,400<br>The amazing feat of the Babylonians is that they were using these geometric games to find the value, </p>
<p>423<br>00:31:07,400 –&gt; 00:31:10,200<br>without any recourse to symbols or formulas. </p>
<p>424<br>00:31:10,200 –&gt; 00:31:13,920<br>The Babylonians were enjoying problem-solving for its own sake. </p>
<p>425<br>00:31:13,920 –&gt; 00:31:17,960<br>They were falling in love with mathematics. </p>
<p>426<br>00:31:29,080 –&gt; 00:31:34,080<br>The Babylonians’ fascination with numbers soon found a place in their leisure time, too. </p>
<p>427<br>00:31:34,080 –&gt; 00:31:35,960<br>They were avid game-players. </p>
<p>428<br>00:31:35,960 –&gt; 00:31:38,760<br>The Babylonians and their descendants have been playing </p>
<p>429<br>00:31:38,760 –&gt; 00:31:43,160<br>a version of backgammon for over 5,000 years. </p>
<p>430<br>00:31:43,160 –&gt; 00:31:45,840<br>The Babylonians played board games, </p>
<p>431<br>00:31:45,840 –&gt; 00:31:52,200<br>from very posh board games in royal tombs to little bits of board games found in schools, </p>
<p>432<br>00:31:52,200 –&gt; 00:31:56,280<br>to board games scratched on the entrances of palaces, </p>
<p>433<br>00:31:56,280 –&gt; 00:32:00,520<br>so that the guardsmen must have played when they were bored, </p>
<p>434<br>00:32:00,520 –&gt; 00:32:03,760<br>and they used dice to move their counters round. </p>
<p>435<br>00:32:04,880 –&gt; 00:32:09,800<br>People who played games were using numbers in their leisure time to try and outwit their opponent, </p>
<p>436<br>00:32:09,800 –&gt; 00:32:12,680<br>doing mental arithmetic very fast, </p>
<p>437<br>00:32:12,680 –&gt; 00:32:17,280<br>and so they were calculating in their leisure time, </p>
<p>438<br>00:32:17,280 –&gt; 00:32:21,000<br>without even thinking about it as being mathematical hard work. </p>
<p>439<br>00:32:23,320 –&gt; 00:32:24,600<br>Now’s my chance. </p>
<p>440<br>00:32:24,600 –&gt; 00:32:30,000<br>‘I hadn’t played backgammon for ages but I reckoned my maths would give me a fighting chance.’ </p>
<p>441<br>00:32:30,000 –&gt; 00:32:33,560</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s up to you.</li>
<li>Six… I need to move something. </li>
</ul>
<p>442<br>00:32:33,560 –&gt; 00:32:36,560<br>‘But it wasn’t as easy as I thought.’ </p>
<p>443<br>00:32:36,560 –&gt; 00:32:38,680<br>Ah! What the hell was that? </p>
<p>444<br>00:32:38,680 –&gt; 00:32:42,440</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>This is one, this is two. </li>
</ul>
<p>445<br>00:32:42,440 –&gt; 00:32:44,200<br>Now you’re in trouble. </p>
<p>446<br>00:32:44,200 –&gt; 00:32:47,800</p>
<ul>
<li>So I can’t move anything. </li>
<li>You cannot move these. </li>
</ul>
<p>447<br>00:32:47,800 –&gt; 00:32:49,200<br>Oh, gosh. </p>
<p>448<br>00:32:50,520 –&gt; 00:32:52,320<br>There you go. </p>
<p>449<br>00:32:53,320 –&gt; 00:32:54,960<br>Three and four. </p>
<p>450<br>00:32:54,960 –&gt; 00:33:00,720<br>‘Just like the ancient Babylonians, my opponents were masters of tactical mathematics.’ </p>
<p>451<br>00:33:00,720 –&gt; 00:33:02,120<br>Yeah. </p>
<p>452<br>00:33:03,120 –&gt; 00:33:05,840<br>Put it there. Good game. </p>
<p>453<br>00:33:07,120 –&gt; 00:33:10,080<br>The Babylonians are recognised as one of the first cultures </p>
<p>454<br>00:33:10,080 –&gt; 00:33:13,840<br>to use symmetrical mathematical shapes to make dice, </p>
<p>455<br>00:33:13,840 –&gt; 00:33:17,440<br>but there is more heated debate about whether they might also </p>
<p>456<br>00:33:17,440 –&gt; 00:33:20,920<br>have been the first to discover the secrets of another important shape. </p>
<p>457<br>00:33:20,920 –&gt; 00:33:24,040<br>The right-angled triangle. </p>
<p>458<br>00:33:27,000 –&gt; 00:33:32,360<br>We’ve already seen how the Egyptians use a 3-4-5 right-angled triangle. </p>
<p>459<br>00:33:32,360 –&gt; 00:33:37,600<br>But what the Babylonians knew about this shape and others like it is much more sophisticated. </p>
<p>460<br>00:33:37,600 –&gt; 00:33:42,120<br>This is the most famous and controversial ancient tablet we have. </p>
<p>461<br>00:33:42,120 –&gt; 00:33:44,480<br>It’s called Plimpton 322. </p>
<p>462<br>00:33:45,480 –&gt; 00:33:49,080<br>Many mathematicians are convinced it shows the Babylonians </p>
<p>463<br>00:33:49,080 –&gt; 00:33:53,360<br>could well have known the principle regarding right-angled triangles, </p>
<p>464<br>00:33:53,360 –&gt; 00:33:57,400<br>that the square on the diagonal is the sum of the squares on the sides, </p>
<p>465<br>00:33:57,400 –&gt; 00:34:00,280<br>and known it centuries before the Greeks claimed it. </p>
<p>466<br>00:34:01,880 –&gt; 00:34:06,320<br>This is a copy of arguably the most famous Babylonian tablet, </p>
<p>467<br>00:34:06,320 –&gt; 00:34:08,040<br>which is Plimpton 322, </p>
<p>468<br>00:34:08,040 –&gt; 00:34:12,680<br>and these numbers here reflect the width or height of a triangle, </p>
<p>469<br>00:34:12,680 –&gt; 00:34:17,520<br>this being the diagonal, the other side would be over here, </p>
<p>470<br>00:34:17,520 –&gt; 00:34:19,880<br>and the square of this column </p>
<p>471<br>00:34:19,880 –&gt; 00:34:23,280<br>plus the square of the number in this column </p>
<p>472<br>00:34:23,280 –&gt; 00:34:26,360<br>equals the square of the diagonal. </p>
<p>473<br>00:34:26,360 –&gt; 00:34:31,120<br>They are arranged in an order of steadily decreasing angle, </p>
<p>474<br>00:34:31,120 –&gt; 00:34:34,000<br>on a very uniform basis, showing that somebody </p>
<p>475<br>00:34:34,000 –&gt; 00:34:38,600<br>had a lot of understanding of how the numbers fit together. </p>
<p>476<br>00:34:44,680 –&gt; 00:34:50,800<br>Here were 15 perfect Pythagorean triangles, all of whose sides had whole-number lengths. </p>
<p>477<br>00:34:50,800 –&gt; 00:34:56,160<br>It’s tempting to think that the Babylonians were the first custodians of Pythagoras’ theorem, </p>
<p>478<br>00:34:56,160 –&gt; 00:35:01,200<br>and it’s a conclusion that generations of historians have been seduced by. </p>
<p>479<br>00:35:01,200 –&gt; 00:35:03,960<br>But there could be a much simpler explanation </p>
<p>480<br>00:35:03,960 –&gt; 00:35:07,760<br>for the sets of three numbers which fulfil Pythagoras’ theorem. </p>
<p>481<br>00:35:07,760 –&gt; 00:35:12,800<br>It’s not a systematic explanation of Pythagorean triples, it’s simply </p>
<p>482<br>00:35:12,800 –&gt; 00:35:17,640<br>a mathematics teacher doing some quite complicated calculations, </p>
<p>483<br>00:35:17,640 –&gt; 00:35:21,160<br>but in order to produce some very simple numbers, </p>
<p>484<br>00:35:21,160 –&gt; 00:35:26,120<br>in order to set his students problems about right-angled triangles, </p>
<p>485<br>00:35:26,120 –&gt; 00:35:31,000<br>and in that sense it’s about Pythagorean triples only incidentally. </p>
<p>486<br>00:35:33,480 –&gt; 00:35:39,040<br>The most valuable clues to what they understood could lie elsewhere. </p>
<p>487<br>00:35:39,040 –&gt; 00:35:43,360<br>This small school exercise tablet is nearly 4,000 years old </p>
<p>488<br>00:35:43,360 –&gt; 00:35:48,800<br>and reveals just what the Babylonians did know about right-angled triangles. </p>
<p>489<br>00:35:48,800 –&gt; 00:35:54,360<br>It uses a principle of Pythagoras’ theorem to find the value of an astounding new number. </p>
<p>490<br>00:35:57,920 –&gt; 00:36:05,000<br>Drawn along the diagonal is a really very good approximation to the square root of two, </p>
<p>491<br>00:36:05,000 –&gt; 00:36:10,880<br>and so that shows us that it was known and used in school environments. </p>
<p>492<br>00:36:10,880 –&gt; 00:36:12,880<br>Why’s this important? </p>
<p>493<br>00:36:12,880 –&gt; 00:36:18,440<br>Because the square root of two is what we now call an irrational number, </p>
<p>494<br>00:36:18,440 –&gt; 00:36:23,960<br>that is, if we write it out in decimals, or even in sexigesimal places, </p>
<p>495<br>00:36:23,960 –&gt; 00:36:28,360<br>it doesn’t end, the numbers go on forever after the decimal point. </p>
<p>496<br>00:36:29,640 –&gt; 00:36:33,640<br>The implications of this calculation are far-reaching. </p>
<p>497<br>00:36:33,640 –&gt; 00:36:37,920<br>Firstly, it means the Babylonians knew something of Pythagoras’ theorem </p>
<p>498<br>00:36:37,920 –&gt; 00:36:39,800<br>1,000 years before Pythagoras. </p>
<p>499<br>00:36:39,800 –&gt; 00:36:45,560<br>Secondly, the fact that they can calculate this number to an accuracy of four decimal places </p>
<p>500<br>00:36:45,560 –&gt; 00:36:50,600<br>shows an amazing arithmetic facility, as well as a passion for mathematical detail. </p>
<p>501<br>00:36:52,200 –&gt; 00:36:56,440<br>The Babylonians’ mathematical dexterity was astounding, </p>
<p>502<br>00:36:56,440 –&gt; 00:37:03,080<br>and for nearly 2,000 years they spearheaded intellectual progress in the ancient world. </p>
<p>503<br>00:37:03,080 –&gt; 00:37:08,280<br>But when their imperial power began to wane, so did their intellectual vigour. </p>
<p>504<br>00:37:16,400 –&gt; 00:37:23,280<br>By 330BC, the Greeks had advanced their imperial reach into old Mesopotamia. </p>
<p>505<br>00:37:25,200 –&gt; 00:37:31,000<br>This is Palmyra in central Syria, a once-great city built by the Greeks. </p>
<p>506<br>00:37:33,800 –&gt; 00:37:41,000<br>The mathematical expertise needed to build structures with such geometric perfection is impressive. </p>
<p>507<br>00:37:42,120 –&gt; 00:37:48,320<br>Just like the Babylonians before them, the Greeks were passionate about mathematics. </p>
<p>508<br>00:37:50,520 –&gt; 00:37:53,080<br>The Greeks were clever colonists. </p>
<p>509<br>00:37:53,080 –&gt; 00:37:56,280<br>They took the best from the civilisations they invaded </p>
<p>510<br>00:37:56,280 –&gt; 00:37:58,720<br>to advance their own power and influence, </p>
<p>511<br>00:37:58,720 –&gt; 00:38:01,880<br>but they were soon making contributions themselves. </p>
<p>512<br>00:38:01,880 –&gt; 00:38:07,080<br>In my opinion, their greatest innovation was to do with a shift in the mind. </p>
<p>513<br>00:38:07,080 –&gt; 00:38:11,560<br>What they initiated would influence humanity for centuries. </p>
<p>514<br>00:38:11,560 –&gt; 00:38:14,520<br>They gave us the power of proof. </p>
<p>515<br>00:38:14,520 –&gt; 00:38:18,200<br>Somehow they decided that they had to have a deductive system </p>
<p>516<br>00:38:18,200 –&gt; 00:38:19,640<br>for their mathematics </p>
<p>517<br>00:38:19,640 –&gt; 00:38:21,800<br>and the typical deductive system </p>
<p>518<br>00:38:21,800 –&gt; 00:38:25,720<br>was to begin with certain axioms, which you assume are true. </p>
<p>519<br>00:38:25,720 –&gt; 00:38:29,080<br>It’s as if you assume a certain theorem is true without proving it. </p>
<p>520<br>00:38:29,080 –&gt; 00:38:34,600<br>And then, using logical methods and very careful steps, </p>
<p>521<br>00:38:34,600 –&gt; 00:38:37,480<br>from these axioms you prove theorems </p>
<p>522<br>00:38:37,480 –&gt; 00:38:42,400<br>and from those theorems you prove more theorems, and it just snowballs. </p>
<p>523<br>00:38:43,520 –&gt; 00:38:47,000<br>Proof is what gives mathematics its strength. </p>
<p>524<br>00:38:47,000 –&gt; 00:38:51,360<br>It’s the power of proof which means that the discoveries of the Greeks </p>
<p>525<br>00:38:51,360 –&gt; 00:38:55,480<br>are as true today as they were 2,000 years ago. </p>
<p>526<br>00:38:55,480 –&gt; 00:39:01,120<br>I needed to head west into the heart of the old Greek empire to learn more. </p>
<p>527<br>00:39:08,720 –&gt; 00:39:14,000<br>For me, Greek mathematics has always been heroic and romantic. </p>
<p>528<br>00:39:15,280 –&gt; 00:39:20,240<br>I’m on my way to Samos, less than a mile from the Turkish coast. </p>
<p>529<br>00:39:20,240 –&gt; 00:39:25,000<br>This place has become synonymous with the birth of Greek mathematics, </p>
<p>530<br>00:39:25,000 –&gt; 00:39:27,920<br>and it’s down to the legend of one man. </p>
<p>531<br>00:39:31,000 –&gt; 00:39:33,120<br>His name is Pythagoras. </p>
<p>532<br>00:39:33,120 –&gt; 00:39:36,520<br>The legends that surround his life and work have contributed </p>
<p>533<br>00:39:36,520 –&gt; 00:39:40,320<br>to the celebrity status he has gained over the last 2,000 years. </p>
<p>534<br>00:39:40,320 –&gt; 00:39:44,960<br>He’s credited, rightly or wrongly, with beginning the transformation </p>
<p>535<br>00:39:44,960 –&gt; 00:39:50,240<br>from mathematics as a tool for accounting to the analytic subject we recognise today. </p>
<p>536<br>00:39:54,160 –&gt; 00:39:57,160<br>Pythagoras is a controversial figure. </p>
<p>537<br>00:39:57,160 –&gt; 00:40:00,360<br>Because he left no mathematical writings, many have questioned </p>
<p>538<br>00:40:00,360 –&gt; 00:40:04,920<br>whether he indeed solved any of the theorems attributed to him. </p>
<p>539<br>00:40:04,920 –&gt; 00:40:07,960<br>He founded a school in Samos in the sixth century BC, </p>
<p>540<br>00:40:07,960 –&gt; 00:40:13,440<br>but his teachings were considered suspect and the Pythagoreans a bizarre sect. </p>
<p>541<br>00:40:14,960 –&gt; 00:40:19,720<br>There is good evidence that there were schools of Pythagoreans, </p>
<p>542<br>00:40:19,720 –&gt; 00:40:22,360<br>and they may have looked more like sects </p>
<p>543<br>00:40:22,360 –&gt; 00:40:25,920<br>than what we associate with philosophical schools, </p>
<p>544<br>00:40:25,920 –&gt; 00:40:30,920<br>because they didn’t just share knowledge, they also shared a way of life. </p>
<p>545<br>00:40:30,920 –&gt; 00:40:36,080<br>There may have been communal living and they all seemed to have been </p>
<p>546<br>00:40:36,080 –&gt; 00:40:40,000<br>involved in the politics of their cities. </p>
<p>547<br>00:40:40,000 –&gt; 00:40:45,440<br>One feature that makes them unusual in the ancient world is that they included women. </p>
<p>548<br>00:40:46,560 –&gt; 00:40:52,280<br>But Pythagoras is synonymous with understanding something that eluded the Egyptians and the Babylonians - </p>
<p>549<br>00:40:52,280 –&gt; 00:40:56,040<br>the properties of right-angled triangles. </p>
<p>550<br>00:40:56,040 –&gt; 00:40:58,400<br>What’s known as Pythagoras’ theorem </p>
<p>551<br>00:40:58,400 –&gt; 00:41:01,360<br>states that if you take any right-angled triangle, </p>
<p>552<br>00:41:01,360 –&gt; 00:41:05,320<br>build squares on all the sides, then the area of the largest square </p>
<p>553<br>00:41:05,320 –&gt; 00:41:09,320<br>is equal to the sum of the squares on the two smaller sides. </p>
<p>554<br>00:41:13,240 –&gt; 00:41:16,680<br>It’s at this point for me that mathematics is born </p>
<p>555<br>00:41:16,680 –&gt; 00:41:19,880<br>and a gulf opens up between the other sciences, </p>
<p>556<br>00:41:19,880 –&gt; 00:41:24,600<br>and the proof is as simple as it is devastating in its implications. </p>
<p>557<br>00:41:24,600 –&gt; 00:41:28,080<br>Place four copies of the right-angled triangle </p>
<p>558<br>00:41:28,080 –&gt; 00:41:29,840<br>on top of this surface. </p>
<p>559<br>00:41:29,840 –&gt; 00:41:31,720<br>The square that you now see </p>
<p>560<br>00:41:31,720 –&gt; 00:41:35,440<br>has sides equal to the hypotenuse of the triangle. </p>
<p>561<br>00:41:35,440 –&gt; 00:41:37,600<br>By sliding these triangles around, </p>
<p>562<br>00:41:37,600 –&gt; 00:41:40,720<br>we see how we can break the area of the large square up </p>
<p>563<br>00:41:40,720 –&gt; 00:41:43,160<br>into the sum of two smaller squares, </p>
<p>564<br>00:41:43,160 –&gt; 00:41:47,280<br>whose sides are given by the two short sides of the triangle. </p>
<p>565<br>00:41:47,280 –&gt; 00:41:52,040<br>In other words, the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum </p>
<p>566<br>00:41:52,040 –&gt; 00:41:55,840<br>of the squares on the other sides. Pythagoras’ theorem. </p>
<p>567<br>00:41:58,040 –&gt; 00:42:02,400<br>It illustrates one of the characteristic themes of Greek mathematics - </p>
<p>568<br>00:42:02,400 –&gt; 00:42:07,600<br>the appeal to beautiful arguments in geometry rather than a reliance on number. </p>
<p>569<br>00:42:11,400 –&gt; 00:42:16,000<br>Pythagoras may have fallen out of favour and many of the discoveries accredited to him </p>
<p>570<br>00:42:16,000 –&gt; 00:42:21,840<br>have been contested recently, but there’s one mathematical theory that I’m loath to take away from him. </p>
<p>571<br>00:42:21,840 –&gt; 00:42:25,840<br>It’s to do with music and the discovery of the harmonic series. </p>
<p>572<br>00:42:27,680 –&gt; 00:42:31,480<br>The story goes that, walking past a blacksmith’s one day, </p>
<p>573<br>00:42:31,480 –&gt; 00:42:33,800<br>Pythagoras heard anvils being struck, </p>
<p>574<br>00:42:33,800 –&gt; 00:42:38,800<br>and noticed how the notes being produced sounded in perfect harmony. </p>
<p>575<br>00:42:38,800 –&gt; 00:42:42,240<br>He believed that there must be some rational explanation </p>
<p>576<br>00:42:42,240 –&gt; 00:42:46,080<br>to make sense of why the notes sounded so appealing. </p>
<p>577<br>00:42:46,080 –&gt; 00:42:48,560<br>The answer was mathematics. </p>
<p>578<br>00:42:53,480 –&gt; 00:42:58,120<br>Experimenting with a stringed instrument, Pythagoras discovered that the intervals between </p>
<p>579<br>00:42:58,120 –&gt; 00:43:02,400<br>harmonious musical notes were always represented as whole-number ratios. </p>
<p>580<br>00:43:05,200 –&gt; 00:43:08,160<br>And here’s how he might have constructed his theory. </p>
<p>581<br>00:43:10,720 –&gt; 00:43:13,600<br>First, play a note on the open string. </p>
<p>582<br>00:43:13,600 –&gt; 00:43:15,120<br>MAN PLAYS NOTE </p>
<p>583<br>00:43:15,120 –&gt; 00:43:17,040<br>Next, take half the length. </p>
<p>584<br>00:43:18,960 –&gt; 00:43:22,160<br>The note almost sounds the same as the first note. </p>
<p>585<br>00:43:22,160 –&gt; 00:43:27,120<br>In fact it’s an octave higher, but the relationship is so strong, we give these notes the same name. </p>
<p>586<br>00:43:27,120 –&gt; 00:43:28,960<br>Now take a third the length. </p>
<p>587<br>00:43:31,600 –&gt; 00:43:35,640<br>We get another note which sounds harmonious next to the first two, </p>
<p>588<br>00:43:35,640 –&gt; 00:43:41,240<br>but take a length of string which is not in a whole-number ratio and all we get is dissonance. </p>
<p>589<br>00:43:46,600 –&gt; 00:43:51,000<br>According to legend, Pythagoras was so excited by this discovery </p>
<p>590<br>00:43:51,000 –&gt; 00:43:54,440<br>that he concluded the whole universe was built from numbers. </p>
<p>591<br>00:43:54,440 –&gt; 00:44:00,040<br>But he and his followers were in for a rather unsettling challenge to their world view </p>
<p>592<br>00:44:00,040 –&gt; 00:44:05,120<br>and it came about as a result of the theorem which bears Pythagoras’ name. </p>
<p>593<br>00:44:07,120 –&gt; 00:44:12,400<br>Legend has it, one of his followers, a mathematician called Hippasus, </p>
<p>594<br>00:44:12,400 –&gt; 00:44:15,480<br>set out to find the length of the diagonal </p>
<p>595<br>00:44:15,480 –&gt; 00:44:19,760<br>for a right-angled triangle with two sides measuring one unit. </p>
<p>596<br>00:44:19,760 –&gt; 00:44:25,520<br>Pythagoras’ theorem implied that the length of the diagonal was a number whose square was two. </p>
<p>597<br>00:44:25,520 –&gt; 00:44:29,560<br>The Pythagoreans assumed that the answer would be a fraction, </p>
<p>598<br>00:44:29,560 –&gt; 00:44:36,000<br>but when Hippasus tried to express it in this way, no matter how he tried, he couldn’t capture it. </p>
<p>599<br>00:44:36,000 –&gt; 00:44:38,600<br>Eventually he realised his mistake. </p>
<p>600<br>00:44:38,600 –&gt; 00:44:43,320<br>It was the assumption that the value was a fraction at all which was wrong. </p>
<p>601<br>00:44:43,320 –&gt; 00:44:49,440<br>The value of the square root of two was the number that the Babylonians etched into the Yale tablet. </p>
<p>602<br>00:44:49,440 –&gt; 00:44:53,320<br>However, they didn’t recognise the special character of this number. </p>
<p>603<br>00:44:53,320 –&gt; 00:44:55,040<br>But Hippasus did. </p>
<p>604<br>00:44:55,040 –&gt; 00:44:57,560<br>It was an irrational number. </p>
<p>605<br>00:45:00,880 –&gt; 00:45:04,800<br>The discovery of this new number, and others like it, is akin to an explorer </p>
<p>606<br>00:45:04,800 –&gt; 00:45:09,240<br>discovering a new continent, or a naturalist finding a new species. </p>
<p>607<br>00:45:09,240 –&gt; 00:45:13,520<br>But these irrational numbers didn’t fit the Pythagorean world view. </p>
<p>608<br>00:45:13,520 –&gt; 00:45:19,120<br>Later Greek commentators tell the story of how Pythagoras swore his sect to secrecy, </p>
<p>609<br>00:45:19,120 –&gt; 00:45:21,840<br>but Hippasus let slip the discovery </p>
<p>610<br>00:45:21,840 –&gt; 00:45:25,600<br>and was promptly drowned for his attempts to broadcast their research. </p>
<p>611<br>00:45:27,080 –&gt; 00:45:32,440<br>But these mathematical discoveries could not be easily suppressed. </p>
<p>612<br>00:45:32,440 –&gt; 00:45:37,920<br>Schools of philosophy and science started to flourish all over Greece, building on these foundations. </p>
<p>613<br>00:45:37,920 –&gt; 00:45:42,360<br>The most famous of these was the Academy. </p>
<p>614<br>00:45:42,360 –&gt; 00:45:47,560<br>Plato founded this school in Athens in 387 BC. </p>
<p>615<br>00:45:47,560 –&gt; 00:45:54,040<br>Although we think of him today as a philosopher, he was one of mathematics’ most important patrons. </p>
<p>616<br>00:45:54,040 –&gt; 00:45:57,720<br>Plato was enraptured by the Pythagorean world view </p>
<p>617<br>00:45:57,720 –&gt; 00:46:02,040<br>and considered mathematics the bedrock of knowledge. </p>
<p>618<br>00:46:02,040 –&gt; 00:46:07,200<br>Some people would say that Plato is the most influential figure </p>
<p>619<br>00:46:07,200 –&gt; 00:46:10,080<br>for our perception of Greek mathematics. </p>
<p>620<br>00:46:10,080 –&gt; 00:46:15,120<br>He argued that mathematics is an important form of knowledge </p>
<p>621<br>00:46:15,120 –&gt; 00:46:17,600<br>and does have a connection with reality. </p>
<p>622<br>00:46:17,600 –&gt; 00:46:23,480<br>So by knowing mathematics, we know more about reality. </p>
<p>623<br>00:46:23,480 –&gt; 00:46:29,240<br>In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposes the thesis that geometry is the key to unlocking </p>
<p>624<br>00:46:29,240 –&gt; 00:46:33,480<br>the secrets of the universe, a view still held by scientists today. </p>
<p>625<br>00:46:33,480 –&gt; 00:46:37,480<br>Indeed, the importance Plato attached to geometry is encapsulated </p>
<p>626<br>00:46:37,480 –&gt; 00:46:43,960<br>in the sign that was mounted above the Academy, “Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.” </p>
<p>627<br>00:46:47,520 –&gt; 00:46:53,720<br>Plato proposed that the universe could be crystallised into five regular symmetrical shapes. </p>
<p>628<br>00:46:53,720 –&gt; 00:46:56,640<br>These shapes, which we now call the Platonic solids, </p>
<p>629<br>00:46:56,640 –&gt; 00:46:59,600<br>were composed of regular polygons, assembled to create </p>
<p>630<br>00:46:59,600 –&gt; 00:47:03,080<br>three-dimensional symmetrical objects. </p>
<p>631<br>00:47:03,080 –&gt; 00:47:05,720<br>The tetrahedron represented fire. </p>
<p>632<br>00:47:05,720 –&gt; 00:47:09,960<br>The icosahedron, made from 20 triangles, represented water. </p>
<p>633<br>00:47:09,960 –&gt; 00:47:12,160<br>The stable cube was Earth. </p>
<p>634<br>00:47:12,160 –&gt; 00:47:15,880<br>The eight-faced octahedron was air. </p>
<p>635<br>00:47:15,880 –&gt; 00:47:19,440<br>And the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, </p>
<p>636<br>00:47:19,440 –&gt; 00:47:22,280<br>made out of 12 pentagons, was reserved for the shape </p>
<p>637<br>00:47:22,280 –&gt; 00:47:26,000<br>that captured Plato’s view of the universe. </p>
<p>638<br>00:47:29,600 –&gt; 00:47:33,640<br>Plato’s theory would have a seismic influence and continued to inspire </p>
<p>639<br>00:47:33,640 –&gt; 00:47:37,400<br>mathematicians and astronomers for over 1,500 years. </p>
<p>640<br>00:47:38,360 –&gt; 00:47:41,120<br>In addition to the breakthroughs made in the Academy, </p>
<p>641<br>00:47:41,120 –&gt; 00:47:45,040<br>mathematical triumphs were also emerging from the edge of the Greek empire, </p>
<p>642<br>00:47:45,040 –&gt; 00:47:51,520<br>and owed as much to the mathematical heritage of the Egyptians as the Greeks. </p>
<p>643<br>00:47:51,520 –&gt; 00:47:58,000<br>Alexandria became a hub of academic excellence under the rule of the Ptolemies in the 3rd century BC, </p>
<p>644<br>00:47:58,000 –&gt; 00:48:04,320<br>and its famous library soon gained a reputation to rival Plato’s Academy. </p>
<p>645<br>00:48:04,320 –&gt; 00:48:11,760<br>The kings of Alexandria were prepared to invest in the arts and culture, </p>
<p>646<br>00:48:11,760 –&gt; 00:48:14,960<br>in technology, mathematics, grammar, </p>
<p>647<br>00:48:14,960 –&gt; 00:48:19,680<br>because patronage for cultural pursuits </p>
<p>648<br>00:48:19,680 –&gt; 00:48:27,000<br>was one way of showing that you were a more prestigious ruler, </p>
<p>649<br>00:48:27,000 –&gt; 00:48:30,320<br>and had a better entitlement to greatness. </p>
<p>650<br>00:48:32,040 –&gt; 00:48:35,360<br>The old library and its precious contents were destroyed </p>
<p>651<br>00:48:35,360 –&gt; 00:48:38,240<br>But its spirit is alive in a new building. </p>
<p>652<br>00:48:40,240 –&gt; 00:48:44,120<br>Today, the library remains a place of discovery and scholarship. </p>
<p>653<br>00:48:48,600 –&gt; 00:48:51,920<br>Mathematicians and philosophers flocked to Alexandria, </p>
<p>654<br>00:48:51,920 –&gt; 00:48:55,080<br>driven by their thirst for knowledge and the pursuit of excellence. </p>
<p>655<br>00:48:55,080 –&gt; 00:48:59,040<br>The patrons of the library were the first professional scientists, </p>
<p>656<br>00:48:59,040 –&gt; 00:49:02,600<br>individuals who were paid for their devotion to research. </p>
<p>657<br>00:49:02,600 –&gt; 00:49:04,720<br>But of all those early pioneers, </p>
<p>658<br>00:49:04,720 –&gt; 00:49:08,880<br>my hero is the enigmatic Greek mathematician Euclid. </p>
<p>659<br>00:49:12,560 –&gt; 00:49:15,120<br>We know very little about Euclid’s life, </p>
<p>660<br>00:49:15,120 –&gt; 00:49:19,360<br>but his greatest achievements were as a chronicler of mathematics. </p>
<p>661<br>00:49:19,360 –&gt; 00:49:24,600<br>Around 300 BC, he wrote the most important text book of all time - </p>
<p>662<br>00:49:24,600 –&gt; 00:49:27,080<br>The Elements. In The Elements, </p>
<p>663<br>00:49:27,080 –&gt; 00:49:31,120<br>we find the culmination of the mathematical revolution </p>
<p>664<br>00:49:31,120 –&gt; 00:49:32,960<br>which had taken place in Greece. </p>
<p>665<br>00:49:34,880 –&gt; 00:49:39,240<br>It’s built on a series of mathematical assumptions, called axioms. </p>
<p>666<br>00:49:39,240 –&gt; 00:49:44,000<br>For example, a line can be drawn between any two points. </p>
<p>667<br>00:49:44,000 –&gt; 00:49:48,760<br>From these axioms, logical deductions are made and mathematical theorems established. </p>
<p>668<br>00:49:51,880 –&gt; 00:49:56,360<br>The Elements contains formulas for calculating the volumes of cones </p>
<p>669<br>00:49:56,360 –&gt; 00:49:59,400<br>and cylinders, proofs about geometric series, </p>
<p>670<br>00:49:59,400 –&gt; 00:50:02,160<br>perfect numbers and primes. </p>
<p>671<br>00:50:02,160 –&gt; 00:50:06,760<br>The climax of The Elements is a proof that there are only five Platonic solids. </p>
<p>672<br>00:50:09,560 –&gt; 00:50:14,280<br>For me, this last theorem captures the power of mathematics. </p>
<p>673<br>00:50:14,280 –&gt; 00:50:17,080<br>It’s one thing to build five symmetrical solids, </p>
<p>674<br>00:50:17,080 –&gt; 00:50:22,600<br>quite another to come up with a watertight, logical argument for why there can’t be a sixth. </p>
<p>675<br>00:50:22,600 –&gt; 00:50:26,600<br>The Elements unfolds like a wonderful, logical mystery novel. </p>
<p>676<br>00:50:26,600 –&gt; 00:50:29,720<br>But this is a story which transcends time. </p>
<p>677<br>00:50:29,720 –&gt; 00:50:33,560<br>Scientific theories get knocked down, from one generation to the next, </p>
<p>678<br>00:50:33,560 –&gt; 00:50:39,920<br>but the theorems in The Elements are as true today as they were 2,000 years ago. </p>
<p>679<br>00:50:39,920 –&gt; 00:50:43,480<br>When you stop and think about it, it’s really amazing. </p>
<p>680<br>00:50:43,480 –&gt; 00:50:45,160<br>It’s the same theorems that we teach. </p>
<p>681<br>00:50:45,160 –&gt; 00:50:49,960<br>We may teach them in a slightly different way, we may organise them differently, </p>
<p>682<br>00:50:49,960 –&gt; 00:50:54,200<br>but it’s Euclidean geometry that is still valid, </p>
<p>683<br>00:50:54,200 –&gt; 00:50:58,320<br>and even in higher mathematics, when you go to higher dimensional spaces, </p>
<p>684<br>00:50:58,320 –&gt; 00:51:00,560<br>you’re still using Euclidean geometry. </p>
<p>685<br>00:51:02,080 –&gt; 00:51:06,080<br>Alexandria must have been an inspiring place for the ancient scholars, </p>
<p>686<br>00:51:06,080 –&gt; 00:51:12,360<br>and Euclid’s fame would have attracted even more eager, young intellectuals to the Egyptian port. </p>
<p>687<br>00:51:12,360 –&gt; 00:51:18,680<br>One mathematician who particularly enjoyed the intellectual environment in Alexandria was Archimedes. </p>
<p>688<br>00:51:19,640 –&gt; 00:51:23,200<br>He would become a mathematical visionary. </p>
<p>689<br>00:51:23,200 –&gt; 00:51:28,080<br>The best Greek mathematicians, they were always pushing the limits, </p>
<p>690<br>00:51:28,080 –&gt; 00:51:29,560<br>pushing the envelope. </p>
<p>691<br>00:51:29,560 –&gt; 00:51:32,200<br>So, Archimedes… </p>
<p>692<br>00:51:32,200 –&gt; 00:51:35,200<br>did what he could with polygons, </p>
<p>693<br>00:51:35,200 –&gt; 00:51:37,520<br>with solids. </p>
<p>694<br>00:51:37,520 –&gt; 00:51:40,360<br>He then moved on to centres of gravity. </p>
<p>695<br>00:51:40,360 –&gt; 00:51:44,680<br>He then moved on to the spiral. </p>
<p>696<br>00:51:44,680 –&gt; 00:51:50,800<br>This instinct to try and mathematise everything </p>
<p>697<br>00:51:50,800 –&gt; 00:51:54,440<br>is something that I see as a legacy. </p>
<p>698<br>00:51:55,520 –&gt; 00:52:00,280<br>One of Archimedes’ specialities was weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>699<br>00:52:00,280 –&gt; 00:52:06,360<br>They were used against the Romans when they invaded his home of Syracuse in 212 BC. </p>
<p>700<br>00:52:06,360 –&gt; 00:52:10,200<br>He also designed mirrors, which harnessed the power of the sun, </p>
<p>701<br>00:52:10,200 –&gt; 00:52:12,760<br>to set the Roman ships on fire. </p>
<p>702<br>00:52:12,760 –&gt; 00:52:17,520<br>But to Archimedes, these endeavours were mere amusements in geometry. </p>
<p>703<br>00:52:17,520 –&gt; 00:52:20,280<br>He had loftier ambitions. </p>
<p>704<br>00:52:23,040 –&gt; 00:52:29,560<br>Archimedes was enraptured by pure mathematics and believed in studying mathematics for its own sake </p>
<p>705<br>00:52:29,560 –&gt; 00:52:33,800<br>and not for the ignoble trade of engineering or the sordid quest for profit. </p>
<p>706<br>00:52:33,800 –&gt; 00:52:37,840<br>One of his finest investigations into pure mathematics </p>
<p>707<br>00:52:37,840 –&gt; 00:52:41,840<br>was to produce formulas to calculate the areas of regular shapes. </p>
<p>708<br>00:52:43,760 –&gt; 00:52:49,480<br>Archimedes’ method was to capture new shapes by using shapes he already understood. </p>
<p>709<br>00:52:49,480 –&gt; 00:52:52,720<br>So, for example, to calculate the area of a circle, </p>
<p>710<br>00:52:52,720 –&gt; 00:52:57,920<br>he would enclose it inside a triangle, and then by doubling the number of sides on the triangle, </p>
<p>711<br>00:52:57,920 –&gt; 00:53:02,320<br>the enclosing shape would get closer and closer to the circle. </p>
<p>712<br>00:53:02,320 –&gt; 00:53:04,360<br>Indeed, we sometimes call a circle </p>
<p>713<br>00:53:04,360 –&gt; 00:53:07,360<br>a polygon with an infinite number of sides. </p>
<p>714<br>00:53:07,360 –&gt; 00:53:11,200<br>But by estimating the area of the circle, Archimedes is, in fact, </p>
<p>715<br>00:53:11,200 –&gt; 00:53:15,480<br>getting a value for pi, the most important number in mathematics. </p>
<p>716<br>00:53:16,480 –&gt; 00:53:22,760<br>However, it was calculating the volumes of solid objects where Archimedes excelled. </p>
<p>717<br>00:53:22,760 –&gt; 00:53:25,800<br>He found a way to calculate the volume of a sphere </p>
<p>718<br>00:53:25,800 –&gt; 00:53:30,280<br>by slicing it up and approximating each slice as a cylinder. </p>
<p>719<br>00:53:30,280 –&gt; 00:53:33,120<br>He then added up the volumes of the slices </p>
<p>720<br>00:53:33,120 –&gt; 00:53:36,480<br>to get an approximate value for the sphere. </p>
<p>721<br>00:53:36,480 –&gt; 00:53:39,440<br>But his act of genius was to see what happens </p>
<p>722<br>00:53:39,440 –&gt; 00:53:42,280<br>if you make the slices thinner and thinner. </p>
<p>723<br>00:53:42,280 –&gt; 00:53:47,040<br>In the limit, the approximation becomes an exact calculation. </p>
<p>724<br>00:53:51,080 –&gt; 00:53:56,040<br>But it was Archimedes’ commitment to mathematics that would be his undoing. </p>
<p>725<br>00:53:58,120 –&gt; 00:54:02,960<br>Archimedes was contemplating a problem about circles traced in the sand. </p>
<p>726<br>00:54:02,960 –&gt; 00:54:05,600<br>When a Roman soldier accosted him, </p>
<p>727<br>00:54:05,600 –&gt; 00:54:11,640<br>Archimedes was so engrossed in his problem that he insisted that he be allowed to finish his theorem. </p>
<p>728<br>00:54:11,640 –&gt; 00:54:16,920<br>But the Roman soldier was not interested in Archimedes’ problem and killed him on the spot. </p>
<p>729<br>00:54:16,920 –&gt; 00:54:21,800<br>Even in death, Archimedes’ devotion to mathematics was unwavering. </p>
<p>730<br>00:54:43,360 –&gt; 00:54:46,480<br>By the middle of the 1st century BC, </p>
<p>731<br>00:54:46,480 –&gt; 00:54:50,520<br>the Romans had tightened their grip on the old Greek empire. </p>
<p>732<br>00:54:50,520 –&gt; 00:54:53,320<br>They were less smitten with the beauty of mathematics </p>
<p>733<br>00:54:53,320 –&gt; 00:54:56,640<br>and were more concerned with its practical applications. </p>
<p>734<br>00:54:56,640 –&gt; 00:55:02,520<br>This pragmatic attitude signalled the beginning of the end for the great library of Alexandria. </p>
<p>735<br>00:55:02,520 –&gt; 00:55:06,760<br>But one mathematician was determined to keep the legacy of the Greeks alive. </p>
<p>736<br>00:55:06,760 –&gt; 00:55:11,640<br>Hypatia was exceptional, a female mathematician, </p>
<p>737<br>00:55:11,640 –&gt; 00:55:14,800<br>and a pagan in the piously Christian Roman empire. </p>
<p>738<br>00:55:16,680 –&gt; 00:55:21,560<br>Hypatia was very prestigious and very influential in her time. </p>
<p>739<br>00:55:21,560 –&gt; 00:55:27,440<br>She was a teacher with a lot of students, a lot of followers. </p>
<p>740<br>00:55:27,440 –&gt; 00:55:31,680<br>She was politically influential in Alexandria. </p>
<p>741<br>00:55:31,680 –&gt; 00:55:34,560<br>So it’s this combination of… </p>
<p>742<br>00:55:34,560 –&gt; 00:55:40,840<br>high knowledge and high prestige that may have made her </p>
<p>743<br>00:55:40,840 –&gt; 00:55:44,400<br>a figure of hatred for… </p>
<p>744<br>00:55:44,400 –&gt; 00:55:46,080<br>the Christian mob. </p>
<p>745<br>00:55:51,760 –&gt; 00:55:55,800<br>One morning during Lent, Hypatia was dragged off her chariot </p>
<p>746<br>00:55:55,800 –&gt; 00:55:59,840<br>by a zealous Christian mob and taken to a church. </p>
<p>747<br>00:55:59,840 –&gt; 00:56:03,560<br>There, she was tortured and brutally murdered. </p>
<p>748<br>00:56:06,280 –&gt; 00:56:09,880<br>The dramatic circumstances of her life and death </p>
<p>749<br>00:56:09,880 –&gt; 00:56:12,000<br>fascinated later generations. </p>
<p>750<br>00:56:12,000 –&gt; 00:56:17,680<br>Sadly, her cult status eclipsed her mathematical achievements. </p>
<p>751<br>00:56:17,680 –&gt; 00:56:20,720<br>She was, in fact, a brilliant teacher and theorist, </p>
<p>752<br>00:56:20,720 –&gt; 00:56:26,440<br>and her death dealt a final blow to the Greek mathematical heritage of Alexandria. </p>
<p>753<br>00:56:33,800 –&gt; 00:56:37,680<br>My travels have taken me on a fascinating journey to uncover </p>
<p>754<br>00:56:37,680 –&gt; 00:56:42,880<br>the passion and innovation of the world’s earliest mathematicians. </p>
<p>755<br>00:56:42,880 –&gt; 00:56:47,920<br>It’s the breakthroughs made by those early pioneers of Egypt, Babylon and Greece </p>
<p>756<br>00:56:47,920 –&gt; 00:56:52,320<br>that are the foundations on which my subject is built today. </p>
<p>757<br>00:56:52,320 –&gt; 00:56:55,760<br>But this is just the beginning of my mathematical odyssey. </p>
<p>758<br>00:56:55,760 –&gt; 00:56:59,400<br>The next leg of my journey lies east, in the depths of Asia, </p>
<p>759<br>00:56:59,400 –&gt; 00:57:02,560<br>where mathematicians scaled even greater heights </p>
<p>760<br>00:57:02,560 –&gt; 00:57:04,800<br>in pursuit of knowledge. </p>
<p>761<br>00:57:04,800 –&gt; 00:57:08,720<br>With this new era came a new language of algebra and numbers, </p>
<p>762<br>00:57:08,720 –&gt; 00:57:12,920<br>better suited to telling the next chapter in the story of maths. </p>
<p>763<br>00:57:12,920 –&gt; 00:57:16,600<br>You can learn more about the story of maths </p>
