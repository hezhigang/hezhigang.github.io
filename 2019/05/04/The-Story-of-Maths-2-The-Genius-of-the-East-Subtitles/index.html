<hr>
<p>1<br>00:00:10,000 –&gt; 00:00:15,520<br>From measuring time to understanding our position in the universe,</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:15,520 –&gt; 00:00:19,960<br>from mapping the Earth to navigating the seas,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:19,960 –&gt; 00:00:24,240<br>from man’s earliest inventions to today’s advanced technologies,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:24,240 –&gt; 00:00:28,680<br>mathematics has been the pivot on which human life depends.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:34,680 –&gt; 00:00:37,040<br>The first steps of man’s mathematical journey</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:37,040 –&gt; 00:00:42,000<br>were taken by the ancient cultures of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece -</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:42,000 –&gt; 00:00:49,240<br>cultures which created the basic language of number and calculation.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:49,240 –&gt; 00:00:51,680<br>But when ancient Greece fell into decline,</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:51,680 –&gt; 00:00:54,160<br>mathematical progress juddered to a halt.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:58,040 –&gt; 00:01:00,120<br>But that was in the West.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:00,120 –&gt; 00:01:04,360<br>In the East, mathematics would reach dynamic new heights.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:08,320 –&gt; 00:01:11,240<br>But in the West, much of this mathematical heritage</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:11,240 –&gt; 00:01:14,600<br>has been conveniently forgotten or shaded from view.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:14,600 –&gt; 00:01:18,200<br>Due credit has not been given to the great mathematical breakthroughs</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:18,200 –&gt; 00:01:21,280<br>that ultimately changed the world we live in.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:21,280 –&gt; 00:01:24,800<br>This is the untold story of the mathematics of the East</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:24,800 –&gt; 00:01:29,000<br>that would transform the West and give birth to the modern world.</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:04,040 –&gt; 00:02:08,800<br>The Great Wall of China stretches for thousands of miles.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:08,800 –&gt; 00:02:12,960<br>Nearly 2,000 years in the making, this vast, defensive wall</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:12,960 –&gt; 00:02:17,800<br>was begun in 220BC to protect China’s growing empire.</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:20,520 –&gt; 00:02:23,840<br>The Great Wall of China is an amazing feat of engineering</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:23,840 –&gt; 00:02:26,600<br>built over rough and high countryside.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:26,600 –&gt; 00:02:28,720<br>As soon as they started building,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:28,720 –&gt; 00:02:31,600<br>the ancient Chinese realised they had to make calculations</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:31,600 –&gt; 00:02:36,080<br>about distances, angles of elevation and amounts of material.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:36,080 –&gt; 00:02:38,560<br>So perhaps it isn’t surprising that this inspired</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:38,560 –&gt; 00:02:43,320<br>some very clever mathematics to help build Imperial China.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:43,320 –&gt; 00:02:46,480<br>At the heart of ancient Chinese mathematics</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:46,480 –&gt; 00:02:49,440<br>was an incredibly simple number system</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:49,440 –&gt; 00:02:53,320<br>which laid the foundations for the way we count in the West today.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:57,760 –&gt; 00:03:03,480<br>When a mathematician wanted to do a sum, he would use small bamboo rods.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:03,480 –&gt; 00:03:07,920<br>These rods were arranged to represent the numbers one to nine.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:14,080 –&gt; 00:03:16,760<br>They were then placed in columns,</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:16,760 –&gt; 00:03:20,840<br>each column representing units, tens,</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:20,840 –&gt; 00:03:23,000<br>hundreds, thousands and so on.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:25,000 –&gt; 00:03:28,440<br>So the number 924 was represented by putting</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:28,440 –&gt; 00:03:33,400<br>the symbol 4 in the units column, the symbol 2 in the tens column</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:33,400 –&gt; 00:03:36,600<br>and the symbol 9 in the hundreds column.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:43,280 –&gt; 00:03:46,440<br>This is what we call a decimal place-value system,</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:46,440 –&gt; 00:03:49,520<br>and it’s very similar to the one we use today.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:49,520 –&gt; 00:03:52,720<br>We too use numbers from one to nine, and we use their position</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:52,720 –&gt; 00:03:57,040<br>to indicate whether it’s units, tens, hundreds or thousands.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:57,040 –&gt; 00:04:00,960<br>But the power of these rods is that it makes calculations very quick.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:00,960 –&gt; 00:04:04,240<br>In fact, the way the ancient Chinese did their calculations</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:04,240 –&gt; 00:04:06,720<br>is very similar to the way we learn today in school.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:12,080 –&gt; 00:04:14,000<br>Not only were the ancient Chinese</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:14,000 –&gt; 00:04:17,480<br>the first to use a decimal place-value system,</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:17,480 –&gt; 00:04:21,840<br>but they did so over 1,000 years before we adopted it in the West.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:21,840 –&gt; 00:04:25,760<br>But they only used it when calculating with the rods.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:25,760 –&gt; 00:04:28,120<br>When writing the numbers down,</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:28,120 –&gt; 00:04:31,160<br>the ancient Chinese didn’t use the place-value system.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:33,760 –&gt; 00:04:37,120<br>Instead, they used a far more laborious method,</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:37,120 –&gt; 00:04:42,520<br>in which special symbols stood for tens, hundreds, thousands and so on.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:44,040 –&gt; 00:04:46,920<br>So the number 924 would be written out</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:46,920 –&gt; 00:04:50,880<br>as nine hundreds, two tens and four.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:50,880 –&gt; 00:04:53,080<br>Not quite so efficient.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:54,600 –&gt; 00:04:56,120<br>The problem was</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:56,120 –&gt; 00:04:59,200<br>that the ancient Chinese didn’t have a concept of zero.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:59,200 –&gt; 00:05:02,920<br>They didn’t have a symbol for zero. It just didn’t exist as a number.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:02,920 –&gt; 00:05:04,760<br>Using the counting rods,</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:04,760 –&gt; 00:05:08,600<br>they would use a blank space where today we would write a zero.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:08,600 –&gt; 00:05:12,120<br>The problem came with trying to write down this number, which is why</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:12,120 –&gt; 00:05:15,840<br>they had to create these new symbols for tens, hundreds and thousands.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:15,840 –&gt; 00:05:20,000<br>Without a zero, the written number was extremely limited.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:23,960 –&gt; 00:05:26,080<br>But the absence of zero didn’t stop</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:26,080 –&gt; 00:05:29,920<br>the ancient Chinese from making giant mathematical steps.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:29,920 –&gt; 00:05:32,440<br>In fact, there was a widespread fascination</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:32,440 –&gt; 00:05:34,920<br>with number in ancient China.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:34,920 –&gt; 00:05:39,040<br>According to legend, the first sovereign of China,</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:39,040 –&gt; 00:05:41,560<br>the Yellow Emperor, had one of his deities</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:41,560 –&gt; 00:05:44,800<br>create mathematics in 2800BC,</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:44,800 –&gt; 00:05:49,720<br>believing that number held cosmic significance. And to this day,</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:49,720 –&gt; 00:05:53,880<br>the Chinese still believe in the mystical power of numbers.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:56,960 –&gt; 00:06:01,440<br>Odd numbers are seen as male, even numbers, female.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:01,440 –&gt; 00:06:04,880<br>The number four is to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:04,880 –&gt; 00:06:07,320<br>The number eight brings good fortune.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:08,440 –&gt; 00:06:11,920<br>And the ancient Chinese were drawn to patterns in numbers,</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:11,920 –&gt; 00:06:15,440<br>developing their own rather early version of sudoku.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:17,520 –&gt; 00:06:20,160<br>It was called the magic square.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:24,080 –&gt; 00:06:28,440<br>Legend has it that thousands of years ago, Emperor Yu was visited</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:28,440 –&gt; 00:06:32,640<br>by a sacred turtle that came out of the depths of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:32,640 –&gt; 00:06:34,480<br>On its back were numbers</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:34,480 –&gt; 00:06:37,600<br>arranged into a magic square, a little like this.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:46,160 –&gt; 00:06:47,960<br>In this square,</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:47,960 –&gt; 00:06:51,640<br>which was regarded as having great religious significance,</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:51,640 –&gt; 00:06:55,880<br>all the numbers in each line - horizontal, vertical and diagonal -</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:55,880 –&gt; 00:06:59,320<br>all add up to the same number - 15.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:02,280 –&gt; 00:07:05,320<br>Now, the magic square may be no more than a fun puzzle,</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:05,320 –&gt; 00:07:07,960<br>but it shows the ancient Chinese fascination</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:07,960 –&gt; 00:07:10,880<br>with mathematical patterns, and it wasn’t too long</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:10,880 –&gt; 00:07:13,880<br>before they were creating even bigger magic squares</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:13,880 –&gt; 00:07:18,000<br>with even greater magical and mathematical powers.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:25,400 –&gt; 00:07:28,160<br>But mathematics also played</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:28,160 –&gt; 00:07:33,320<br>a vital role in the running of the emperor’s court.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:33,320 –&gt; 00:07:35,880<br>The calendar and the movement of the planets</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:35,880 –&gt; 00:07:38,960<br>were of the utmost importance to the emperor,</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:38,960 –&gt; 00:07:43,760<br>influencing all his decisions, even down to the way his day was planned,</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:43,760 –&gt; 00:07:47,440<br>so astronomers became prized members of the imperial court,</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:47,440 –&gt; 00:07:50,960<br>and astronomers were always mathematicians.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:55,720 –&gt; 00:07:58,920<br>Everything in the emperor’s life was governed by the calendar,</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:58,920 –&gt; 00:08:02,280<br>and he ran his affairs with mathematical precision.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:02,280 –&gt; 00:08:05,480<br>The emperor even got his mathematical advisors</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:05,480 –&gt; 00:08:08,120<br>to come up with a system to help him sleep his way</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:08,120 –&gt; 00:08:11,480<br>through the vast number of women he had in his harem.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:11,480 –&gt; 00:08:14,680<br>Never one to miss a trick, the mathematical advisors decided</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:14,680 –&gt; 00:08:19,480<br>to base the harem on a mathematical idea called a geometric progression.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:19,480 –&gt; 00:08:23,360<br>Maths has never had such a fun purpose!</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:23,360 –&gt; 00:08:26,440<br>Legend has it that in the space of 15 nights,</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:26,440 –&gt; 00:08:30,200<br>the emperor had to sleep with 121 women…</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:36,120 –&gt; 00:08:38,400<br>..the empress,</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:38,400 –&gt; 00:08:40,680<br>three senior consorts,</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:40,680 –&gt; 00:08:43,120<br>nine wives,</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:43,120 –&gt; 00:08:45,200<br>27 concubines</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:45,200 –&gt; 00:08:47,480<br>and 81 slaves.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:49,280 –&gt; 00:08:52,200<br>The mathematicians would soon have realised</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:52,200 –&gt; 00:08:56,040<br>that this was a geometric progression - a series of numbers</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:56,040 –&gt; 00:08:58,560<br>in which you get from one number to the next</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:58,560 –&gt; 00:09:03,080<br>by multiplying the same number each time - in this case, three.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:04,280 –&gt; 00:09:08,520<br>Each group of women is three times as large as the previous group,</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:08,520 –&gt; 00:09:12,840<br>so the mathematicians could quickly draw up a rota to ensure that,</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:12,840 –&gt; 00:09:14,840<br>in the space of 15 nights,</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:14,840 –&gt; 00:09:18,200<br>the emperor slept with every woman in the harem.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:19,720 –&gt; 00:09:23,520<br>The first night was reserved for the empress.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:23,520 –&gt; 00:09:26,360<br>The next was for the three senior consorts.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:26,360 –&gt; 00:09:29,040<br>The nine wives came next,</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:29,040 –&gt; 00:09:35,200<br>and then the 27 concubines were chosen in rotation, nine each night.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:35,200 –&gt; 00:09:38,880<br>And then finally, over a period of nine nights,</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:38,880 –&gt; 00:09:42,040<br>the 81 slaves were dealt with in groups of nine.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:47,920 –&gt; 00:09:50,800<br>Being the emperor certainly required stamina,</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:50,800 –&gt; 00:09:52,560<br>a bit like being a mathematician,</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:52,560 –&gt; 00:09:54,600<br>but the object is clear -</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:54,600 –&gt; 00:09:58,440<br>to procure the best possible imperial succession.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:58,440 –&gt; 00:10:00,440<br>The rota ensured that the emperor</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:00,440 –&gt; 00:10:04,240<br>slept with the ladies of highest rank closest to the full moon,</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:04,240 –&gt; 00:10:06,640<br>when their yin, their female force,</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:06,640 –&gt; 00:10:11,200<br>would be at its highest and be able to match his yang, or male force.</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:16,440 –&gt; 00:10:20,560<br>The emperor’s court wasn’t alone in its dependence on mathematics.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:20,560 –&gt; 00:10:23,360<br>It was central to the running of the state.</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:23,360 –&gt; 00:10:28,320<br>Ancient China was a vast and growing empire with a strict legal code,</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:28,320 –&gt; 00:10:30,000<br>widespread taxation</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:30,000 –&gt; 00:10:33,640<br>and a standardised system of weights, measures and money.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:35,560 –&gt; 00:10:37,360<br>The empire needed</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:37,360 –&gt; 00:10:41,560<br>a highly trained civil service, competent in mathematics.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:43,640 –&gt; 00:10:47,640<br>And to educate these civil servants was a mathematical textbook,</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:47,640 –&gt; 00:10:51,800<br>probably written in around 200BC - the Nine Chapters.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:54,360 –&gt; 00:10:58,200<br>The book is a compilation of 246 problems</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:58,200 –&gt; 00:11:02,920<br>in practical areas such as trade, payment of wages and taxes.</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:05,760 –&gt; 00:11:08,800<br>And at the heart of these problems lies</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:08,800 –&gt; 00:11:13,400<br>one of the central themes of mathematics, how to solve equations.</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:16,160 –&gt; 00:11:19,160<br>Equations are a little bit like cryptic crosswords.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:19,160 –&gt; 00:11:21,560<br>You’re given a certain amount of information</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:21,560 –&gt; 00:11:24,440<br>about some unknown numbers, and from that information</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:24,440 –&gt; 00:11:27,320<br>you’ve got to deduce what the unknown numbers are.</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:27,320 –&gt; 00:11:29,600<br>For example, with my weights and scales,</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:29,600 –&gt; 00:11:31,640<br>I’ve found out that one plum…</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:32,760 –&gt; 00:11:35,920<br>..together with three peaches</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:35,920 –&gt; 00:11:39,480<br>weighs a total of 15g.</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:41,240 –&gt; 00:11:42,640<br>But…</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:43,840 –&gt; 00:11:45,760<br>..two plums</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:45,760 –&gt; 00:11:48,440<br>together with one peach</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:48,440 –&gt; 00:11:50,720<br>weighs a total of 10g.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:50,720 –&gt; 00:11:55,040<br>From this information, I can deduce what a single plum weighs</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:55,040 –&gt; 00:11:59,120<br>and a single peach weighs, and this is how I do it.</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:00,640 –&gt; 00:12:02,640<br>If I take the first set of scales,</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:02,640 –&gt; 00:12:05,280<br>one plum and three peaches weighing 15g,</p>
<p>166<br>00:12:05,280 –&gt; 00:12:11,560<br>and double it, I get two plums and six peaches weighing 30g.</p>
<p>167<br>00:12:14,320 –&gt; 00:12:18,160<br>If I take this and subtract from it the second set of scales -</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:18,160 –&gt; 00:12:20,880<br>that’s two plums and a peach weighing 10g -</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:20,880 –&gt; 00:12:23,640<br>I’m left with an interesting result -</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:23,640 –&gt; 00:12:25,960<br>no plums.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:25,960 –&gt; 00:12:28,120<br>Having eliminated the plums,</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:28,120 –&gt; 00:12:31,360<br>I’ve discovered that five peaches weighs 20g,</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:31,360 –&gt; 00:12:34,320<br>so a single peach weighs 4g,</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:34,320 –&gt; 00:12:39,640<br>and from this I can deduce that the plum weighs 3g.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:39,640 –&gt; 00:12:42,680<br>The ancient Chinese went on to apply similar methods</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:42,680 –&gt; 00:12:45,560<br>to larger and larger numbers of unknowns,</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:45,560 –&gt; 00:12:50,680<br>using it to solve increasingly complicated equations.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:50,680 –&gt; 00:12:52,560<br>What’s extraordinary is</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:52,560 –&gt; 00:12:55,280<br>that this particular system of solving equations</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:55,280 –&gt; 00:12:59,160<br>didn’t appear in the West until the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:59,160 –&gt; 00:13:03,520<br>In 1809, while analysing a rock called Pallas in the asteroid belt,</p>
<p>182<br>00:13:03,520 –&gt; 00:13:05,360<br>Carl Friedrich Gauss,</p>
<p>183<br>00:13:05,360 –&gt; 00:13:08,160<br>who would become known as the prince of mathematics,</p>
<p>184<br>00:13:08,160 –&gt; 00:13:09,840<br>rediscovered this method</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:09,840 –&gt; 00:13:13,440<br>which had been formulated in ancient China centuries earlier.</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:13,440 –&gt; 00:13:17,400<br>Once again, ancient China streets ahead of Europe.</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:21,240 –&gt; 00:13:23,800<br>But the Chinese were to go on to solve</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:23,800 –&gt; 00:13:27,800<br>even more complicated equations involving far larger numbers.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:27,800 –&gt; 00:13:31,040<br>In what’s become known as the Chinese remainder theorem,</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:31,040 –&gt; 00:13:35,600<br>the Chinese came up with a new kind of problem.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:35,600 –&gt; 00:13:38,440<br>In this, we know the number that’s left</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:38,440 –&gt; 00:13:42,280<br>when the equation’s unknown number is divided by a given number -</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:42,280 –&gt; 00:13:44,320<br>say, three, five or seven.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:46,160 –&gt; 00:13:50,360<br>Of course, this is a fairly abstract mathematical problem,</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:50,360 –&gt; 00:13:54,520<br>but the ancient Chinese still couched it in practical terms.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:56,600 –&gt; 00:13:59,600<br>So a woman in the market has a tray of eggs,</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:59,600 –&gt; 00:14:02,440<br>but she doesn’t know how many eggs she’s got.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:02,440 –&gt; 00:14:05,800<br>What she does know is that if she arranges them in threes,</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:05,800 –&gt; 00:14:08,960<br>she has one egg left over.</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:08,960 –&gt; 00:14:13,360<br>If she arranges them in fives, she gets two eggs left over.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:13,360 –&gt; 00:14:15,840<br>But if she arranged them in rows of seven,</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:15,840 –&gt; 00:14:18,640<br>she found she had three eggs left over.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:18,640 –&gt; 00:14:22,320<br>The ancient Chinese found a systematic way to calculate</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:22,320 –&gt; 00:14:26,320<br>that the smallest number of eggs she could have had in the tray is 52.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:26,320 –&gt; 00:14:29,400<br>But the more amazing thing is that you can capture</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:29,400 –&gt; 00:14:31,240<br>such a large number, like 52,</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:31,240 –&gt; 00:14:34,760<br>by using these small numbers like three, five and seven.</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:34,760 –&gt; 00:14:36,760<br>This way of looking at numbers</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:36,760 –&gt; 00:14:40,520<br>would become a dominant theme over the last two centuries.</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:49,160 –&gt; 00:14:53,880<br>By the 6th century AD, the Chinese remainder theorem was being used</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:53,880 –&gt; 00:14:57,360<br>in ancient Chinese astronomy to measure planetary movement.</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:57,360 –&gt; 00:15:00,760<br>But today it still has practical uses.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:00,760 –&gt; 00:15:05,600<br>Internet cryptography encodes numbers using mathematics</p>
<p>214<br>00:15:05,600 –&gt; 00:15:09,800<br>that has its origins in the Chinese remainder theorem.</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:17,600 –&gt; 00:15:19,400<br>By the 13th century,</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:19,400 –&gt; 00:15:22,480<br>mathematics was long established on the curriculum,</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:22,480 –&gt; 00:15:26,480<br>with over 30 mathematics schools scattered across the country.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:26,480 –&gt; 00:15:30,440<br>The golden age of Chinese maths had arrived.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:32,200 –&gt; 00:15:36,360<br>And its most important mathematician was called Qin Jiushao.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:38,560 –&gt; 00:15:43,480<br>Legend has it that Qin Jiushao was something of a scoundrel.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:43,480 –&gt; 00:15:47,280<br>He was a fantastically corrupt imperial administrator</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:47,280 –&gt; 00:15:50,840<br>who crisscrossed China, lurching from one post to another.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:50,840 –&gt; 00:15:54,360<br>Repeatedly sacked for embezzling government money,</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:54,360 –&gt; 00:15:57,280<br>he poisoned anyone who got in his way.</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:59,600 –&gt; 00:16:02,240<br>Qin Jiushao was reputedly described as</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:02,240 –&gt; 00:16:04,680<br>as violent as a tiger or a wolf</p>
<p>227<br>00:16:04,680 –&gt; 00:16:07,760<br>and as poisonous as a scorpion or a viper</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:07,760 –&gt; 00:16:10,880<br>so, not surprisingly, he made a fierce warrior.</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:10,880 –&gt; 00:16:13,800<br>For ten years, he fought against the invading Mongols,</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:13,800 –&gt; 00:16:17,240<br>but for much of that time he was complaining that his military life</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:17,240 –&gt; 00:16:19,520<br>took him away from his true passion.</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:19,520 –&gt; 00:16:22,520<br>No, not corruption, but mathematics.</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:34,080 –&gt; 00:16:36,640<br>Qin started trying to solve equations</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:36,640 –&gt; 00:16:39,920<br>that grew out of trying to measure the world around us.</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:39,920 –&gt; 00:16:41,800<br>Quadratic equations involve numbers</p>
<p>236<br>00:16:41,800 –&gt; 00:16:46,600<br>that are squared, or to the power of two - say, five times five.</p>
<p>237<br>00:16:47,960 –&gt; 00:16:49,640<br>The ancient Mesopotamians</p>
<p>238<br>00:16:49,640 –&gt; 00:16:52,680<br>had already realised that these equations</p>
<p>239<br>00:16:52,680 –&gt; 00:16:55,400<br>were perfect for measuring flat, two-dimensional shapes,</p>
<p>240<br>00:16:55,400 –&gt; 00:16:57,160<br>like Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:00,120 –&gt; 00:17:02,320<br>But Qin was interested</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:02,320 –&gt; 00:17:06,280<br>in more complicated equations - cubic equations.</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:08,000 –&gt; 00:17:10,800<br>These involve numbers which are cubed,</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:10,800 –&gt; 00:17:15,520<br>or to the power of three - say, five times five times five,</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:15,520 –&gt; 00:17:19,320<br>and they were perfect for capturing three-dimensional shapes,</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:19,320 –&gt; 00:17:21,720<br>like Chairman Mao’s mausoleum.</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:23,240 –&gt; 00:17:26,000<br>Qin found a way of solving cubic equations,</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:26,000 –&gt; 00:17:28,560<br>and this is how it worked.</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:32,400 –&gt; 00:17:34,440<br>Say Qin wants to know</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:34,440 –&gt; 00:17:37,600<br>the exact dimensions of Chairman Mao’s mausoleum.</p>
<p>251<br>00:17:39,800 –&gt; 00:17:42,080<br>He knows the volume of the building</p>
<p>252<br>00:17:42,080 –&gt; 00:17:45,320<br>and the relationships between the dimensions.</p>
<p>253<br>00:17:47,000 –&gt; 00:17:49,320<br>In order to get his answer,</p>
<p>254<br>00:17:49,320 –&gt; 00:17:53,880<br>Qin uses what he knows to produce a cubic equation.</p>
<p>255<br>00:17:53,880 –&gt; 00:17:57,800<br>He then makes an educated guess at the dimensions.</p>
<p>256<br>00:17:57,800 –&gt; 00:18:01,520<br>Although he’s captured a good proportion of the mausoleum,</p>
<p>257<br>00:18:01,520 –&gt; 00:18:03,600<br>there are still bits left over.</p>
<p>258<br>00:18:05,080 –&gt; 00:18:09,040<br>Qin takes these bits and creates a new cubic equation.</p>
<p>259<br>00:18:09,040 –&gt; 00:18:11,120<br>He can now refine his first guess</p>
<p>260<br>00:18:11,120 –&gt; 00:18:15,200<br>by trying to find a solution to this new cubic equation, and so on.</p>
<p>261<br>00:18:18,320 –&gt; 00:18:21,960<br>Each time he does this, the pieces he’s left with</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:21,960 –&gt; 00:18:26,440<br>get smaller and smaller and his guesses get better and better.</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:28,120 –&gt; 00:18:31,640<br>What’s striking is that Qin’s method for solving equations</p>
<p>264<br>00:18:31,640 –&gt; 00:18:34,880<br>wasn’t discovered in the West until the 17th century,</p>
<p>265<br>00:18:34,880 –&gt; 00:18:39,360<br>when Isaac Newton came up with a very similar approximation method.</p>
<p>266<br>00:18:39,360 –&gt; 00:18:41,840<br>The power of this technique is</p>
<p>267<br>00:18:41,840 –&gt; 00:18:46,000<br>that it can be applied to even more complicated equations.</p>
<p>268<br>00:18:46,000 –&gt; 00:18:49,720<br>Qin even used his techniques to solve an equation</p>
<p>269<br>00:18:49,720 –&gt; 00:18:51,960<br>involving numbers up to the power of ten.</p>
<p>270<br>00:18:51,960 –&gt; 00:18:56,000<br>This was extraordinary stuff - highly complex mathematics.</p>
<p>271<br>00:18:58,400 –&gt; 00:19:00,800<br>Qin may have been years ahead of his time,</p>
<p>272<br>00:19:00,800 –&gt; 00:19:03,120<br>but there was a problem with his technique.</p>
<p>273<br>00:19:03,120 –&gt; 00:19:05,960<br>It only gave him an approximate solution.</p>
<p>274<br>00:19:05,960 –&gt; 00:19:09,880<br>That might be good enough for an engineer - not for a mathematician.</p>
<p>275<br>00:19:09,880 –&gt; 00:19:13,440<br>Mathematics is an exact science. We like things to be precise,</p>
<p>276<br>00:19:13,440 –&gt; 00:19:16,320<br>and Qin just couldn’t come up with a formula</p>
<p>277<br>00:19:16,320 –&gt; 00:19:19,840<br>to give him an exact solution to these complicated equations.</p>
<p>278<br>00:19:27,840 –&gt; 00:19:30,280<br>China had made great mathematical leaps,</p>
<p>279<br>00:19:30,280 –&gt; 00:19:34,240<br>but the next great mathematical breakthroughs were to happen</p>
<p>280<br>00:19:34,240 –&gt; 00:19:37,040<br>in a country lying to the southwest of China -</p>
<p>281<br>00:19:37,040 –&gt; 00:19:40,360<br>a country that had a rich mathematical tradition</p>
<p>282<br>00:19:40,360 –&gt; 00:19:43,360<br>that would change the face of maths for ever.</p>
<p>283<br>00:20:13,840 –&gt; 00:20:18,560<br>India’s first great mathematical gift lay in the world of number.</p>
<p>284<br>00:20:18,560 –&gt; 00:20:22,640<br>Like the Chinese, the Indians had discovered the mathematical benefits</p>
<p>285<br>00:20:22,640 –&gt; 00:20:24,560<br>of the decimal place-value system</p>
<p>286<br>00:20:24,560 –&gt; 00:20:28,520<br>and were using it by the middle of the 3rd century AD.</p>
<p>287<br>00:20:30,600 –&gt; 00:20:34,200<br>It’s been suggested that the Indians learned the system</p>
<p>288<br>00:20:34,200 –&gt; 00:20:38,800<br>from Chinese merchants travelling in India with their counting rods,</p>
<p>289<br>00:20:38,800 –&gt; 00:20:42,640<br>or they may well just have stumbled across it themselves.</p>
<p>290<br>00:20:42,640 –&gt; 00:20:46,120<br>It’s all such a long time ago that it’s shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>291<br>00:20:48,320 –&gt; 00:20:51,840<br>We may never know how the Indians came up with their number system,</p>
<p>292<br>00:20:51,840 –&gt; 00:20:54,880<br>but we do know that they refined and perfected it,</p>
<p>293<br>00:20:54,880 –&gt; 00:20:58,800<br>creating the ancestors for the nine numerals used across the world now.</p>
<p>294<br>00:20:58,800 –&gt; 00:21:01,480<br>Many rank the Indian system of counting</p>
<p>295<br>00:21:01,480 –&gt; 00:21:05,040<br>as one of the greatest intellectual innovations of all time,</p>
<p>296<br>00:21:05,040 –&gt; 00:21:09,200<br>developing into the closest thing we could call a universal language.</p>
<p>297<br>00:21:27,120 –&gt; 00:21:29,600<br>But there was one number missing,</p>
<p>298<br>00:21:29,600 –&gt; 00:21:33,440<br>and it was the Indians who would introduce it to the world.</p>
<p>299<br>00:21:39,960 –&gt; 00:21:44,400<br>The earliest known recording of this number dates from the 9th century,</p>
<p>300<br>00:21:44,400 –&gt; 00:21:48,080<br>though it was probably in practical use for centuries before.</p>
<p>301<br>00:21:49,720 –&gt; 00:21:53,560<br>This strange new numeral is engraved on the wall</p>
<p>302<br>00:21:53,560 –&gt; 00:21:57,360<br>of small temple in the fort of Gwalior in central India.</p>
<p>303<br>00:22:01,480 –&gt; 00:22:05,400<br>So here we are in one of the holy sites of the mathematical world,</p>
<p>304<br>00:22:05,400 –&gt; 00:22:08,840<br>and what I’m looking for is in this inscription on the wall.</p>
<p>305<br>00:22:09,800 –&gt; 00:22:12,600<br>Up here are some numbers, and…</p>
<p>306<br>00:22:12,600 –&gt; 00:22:14,880<br>here’s the new number.</p>
<p>307<br>00:22:14,880 –&gt; 00:22:16,880<br>It’s zero.</p>
<p>308<br>00:22:21,600 –&gt; 00:22:25,720<br>It’s astonishing to think that before the Indians invented it,</p>
<p>309<br>00:22:25,720 –&gt; 00:22:28,120<br>there was no number zero.</p>
<p>310<br>00:22:28,120 –&gt; 00:22:31,280<br>To the ancient Greeks, it simply hadn’t existed.</p>
<p>311<br>00:22:31,280 –&gt; 00:22:35,520<br>To the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians and, as we’ve seen, the Chinese,</p>
<p>312<br>00:22:35,520 –&gt; 00:22:39,720<br>zero had been in use but as a placeholder, an empty space</p>
<p>313<br>00:22:39,720 –&gt; 00:22:42,040<br>to show a zero inside a number.</p>
<p>314<br>00:22:45,320 –&gt; 00:22:48,400<br>The Indians transformed zero from a mere placeholder</p>
<p>315<br>00:22:48,400 –&gt; 00:22:51,320<br>into a number that made sense in its own right -</p>
<p>316<br>00:22:51,320 –&gt; 00:22:54,280<br>a number for calculation, for investigation.</p>
<p>317<br>00:22:54,280 –&gt; 00:22:58,480<br>This brilliant conceptual leap would revolutionise mathematics.</p>
<p>318<br>00:23:02,400 –&gt; 00:23:06,760<br>Now, with just ten digits - zero to nine - it was suddenly possible</p>
<p>319<br>00:23:06,760 –&gt; 00:23:09,760<br>to capture astronomically large numbers</p>
<p>320<br>00:23:09,760 –&gt; 00:23:12,040<br>in an incredibly efficient way.</p>
<p>321<br>00:23:15,040 –&gt; 00:23:18,360<br>But why did the Indians make this imaginative leap?</p>
<p>322<br>00:23:18,360 –&gt; 00:23:20,560<br>Well, we’ll never know for sure,</p>
<p>323<br>00:23:20,560 –&gt; 00:23:24,520<br>but it’s possible that the idea and symbol that the Indians use for zero</p>
<p>324<br>00:23:24,520 –&gt; 00:23:27,720<br>came from calculations they did with stones in the sand.</p>
<p>325<br>00:23:27,720 –&gt; 00:23:31,040<br>When stones were removed from the calculation,</p>
<p>326<br>00:23:31,040 –&gt; 00:23:33,800<br>a small, round hole was left in its place,</p>
<p>327<br>00:23:33,800 –&gt; 00:23:37,160<br>representing the movement from something to nothing.</p>
<p>328<br>00:23:39,800 –&gt; 00:23:44,120<br>But perhaps there is also a cultural reason for the invention of zero.</p>
<p>329<br>00:23:44,120 –&gt; 00:23:47,680<br>HORNS BLOW AND DRUMS BANG</p>
<p>330<br>00:23:47,680 –&gt; 00:23:50,600<br>METALLIC BEATING</p>
<p>331<br>00:23:53,040 –&gt; 00:23:57,520<br>For the ancient Indians, the concepts of nothingness and eternity</p>
<p>332<br>00:23:57,520 –&gt; 00:24:00,440<br>lay at the very heart of their belief system.</p>
<p>333<br>00:24:04,920 –&gt; 00:24:07,360<br>BELL CLANGS AND SILENCE FALLS</p>
<p>334<br>00:24:09,880 –&gt; 00:24:13,880<br>In the religions of India, the universe was born from nothingness,</p>
<p>335<br>00:24:13,880 –&gt; 00:24:17,000<br>and nothingness is the ultimate goal of humanity.</p>
<p>336<br>00:24:17,000 –&gt; 00:24:18,840<br>So it’s perhaps not surprising</p>
<p>337<br>00:24:18,840 –&gt; 00:24:22,680<br>that a culture that so enthusiastically embraced the void</p>
<p>338<br>00:24:22,680 –&gt; 00:24:25,880<br>should be happy with the notion of zero.</p>
<p>339<br>00:24:25,880 –&gt; 00:24:30,080<br>The Indians even used the word for the philosophical idea of the void,</p>
<p>340<br>00:24:30,080 –&gt; 00:24:33,920<br>shunya, to represent the new mathematical term “zero”.</p>
<p>341<br>00:24:47,280 –&gt; 00:24:52,680<br>In the 7th century, the brilliant Indian mathematician Brahmagupta</p>
<p>342<br>00:24:52,680 –&gt; 00:24:55,680<br>proved some of the essential properties of zero.</p>
<p>343<br>00:25:01,480 –&gt; 00:25:04,320<br>Brahmagupta’s rules about calculating with zero</p>
<p>344<br>00:25:04,320 –&gt; 00:25:08,280<br>are taught in schools all over the world to this day.</p>
<p>345<br>00:25:09,240 –&gt; 00:25:12,240<br>One plus zero equals one.</p>
<p>346<br>00:25:13,280 –&gt; 00:25:16,640<br>One minus zero equals one.</p>
<p>347<br>00:25:16,640 –&gt; 00:25:19,920<br>One times zero is equal to zero.</p>
<p>348<br>00:25:24,120 –&gt; 00:25:28,680<br>But Brahmagupta came a cropper when he tried to do one divided by zero.</p>
<p>349<br>00:25:28,680 –&gt; 00:25:31,880<br>After all, what number times zero equals one?</p>
<p>350<br>00:25:31,880 –&gt; 00:25:35,760<br>It would require a new mathematical concept, that of infinity,</p>
<p>351<br>00:25:35,760 –&gt; 00:25:38,000<br>to make sense of dividing by zero,</p>
<p>352<br>00:25:38,000 –&gt; 00:25:41,920<br>and the breakthrough was made by a 12th-century Indian mathematician</p>
<p>353<br>00:25:41,920 –&gt; 00:25:45,040<br>called Bhaskara II, and it works like this.</p>
<p>354<br>00:25:45,040 –&gt; 00:25:51,200<br>If I take a fruit and I divide it into halves, I get two pieces,</p>
<p>355<br>00:25:51,200 –&gt; 00:25:54,080<br>so one divided by a half is two.</p>
<p>356<br>00:25:54,080 –&gt; 00:25:57,480<br>If I divide it into thirds, I get three pieces.</p>
<p>357<br>00:25:57,480 –&gt; 00:26:00,920<br>So when I divide it into smaller and smaller fractions,</p>
<p>358<br>00:26:00,920 –&gt; 00:26:04,640<br>I get more and more pieces, so ultimately,</p>
<p>359<br>00:26:04,640 –&gt; 00:26:06,600<br>when I divide by a piece</p>
<p>360<br>00:26:06,600 –&gt; 00:26:10,400<br>which is of zero size, I’ll have infinitely many pieces.</p>
<p>361<br>00:26:10,400 –&gt; 00:26:14,560<br>So for Bhaskara, one divided by zero is infinity.</p>
<p>362<br>00:26:22,880 –&gt; 00:26:26,680<br>But the Indians would go further in their calculations with zero.</p>
<p>363<br>00:26:27,840 –&gt; 00:26:31,920<br>For example, if you take three from three and get zero,</p>
<p>364<br>00:26:31,920 –&gt; 00:26:35,240<br>what happens when you take four from three?</p>
<p>365<br>00:26:35,240 –&gt; 00:26:37,480<br>It looks like you have nothing,</p>
<p>366<br>00:26:37,480 –&gt; 00:26:39,720<br>but the Indians recognised that this</p>
<p>367<br>00:26:39,720 –&gt; 00:26:43,720<br>was a new sort of nothing - negative numbers.</p>
<p>368<br>00:26:43,720 –&gt; 00:26:47,440<br>The Indians called them “debts”, because they solved equations like,</p>
<p>369<br>00:26:47,440 –&gt; 00:26:51,040<br>“If I have three batches of material and take four away,</p>
<p>370<br>00:26:51,040 –&gt; 00:26:53,200<br>“how many have I left?”</p>
<p>371<br>00:26:56,880 –&gt; 00:26:58,840<br>This may seem odd and impractical,</p>
<p>372<br>00:26:58,840 –&gt; 00:27:01,400<br>but that was the beauty of Indian mathematics.</p>
<p>373<br>00:27:01,400 –&gt; 00:27:04,680<br>Their ability to come up with negative numbers and zero</p>
<p>374<br>00:27:04,680 –&gt; 00:27:08,080<br>was because they thought of numbers as abstract entities.</p>
<p>375<br>00:27:08,080 –&gt; 00:27:11,360<br>They weren’t just for counting and measuring pieces of cloth.</p>
<p>376<br>00:27:11,360 –&gt; 00:27:15,000<br>They had a life of their own, floating free of the real world.</p>
<p>377<br>00:27:15,000 –&gt; 00:27:19,000<br>This led to an explosion of mathematical ideas.</p>
<p>378<br>00:27:30,880 –&gt; 00:27:34,560<br>The Indians’ abstract approach to mathematics soon revealed</p>
<p>379<br>00:27:34,560 –&gt; 00:27:38,440<br>a new side to the problem of how to solve quadratic equations.</p>
<p>380<br>00:27:38,440 –&gt; 00:27:42,000<br>That is equations including numbers to the power of two.</p>
<p>381<br>00:27:43,520 –&gt; 00:27:47,520<br>Brahmagupta’s understanding of negative numbers allowed him to see</p>
<p>382<br>00:27:47,520 –&gt; 00:27:50,720<br>that quadratic equations always have two solutions,</p>
<p>383<br>00:27:50,720 –&gt; 00:27:52,600<br>one of which could be negative.</p>
<p>384<br>00:27:55,120 –&gt; 00:27:57,040<br>Brahmagupta went even further,</p>
<p>385<br>00:27:57,040 –&gt; 00:28:00,000<br>solving quadratic equations with two unknowns,</p>
<p>386<br>00:28:00,000 –&gt; 00:28:04,040<br>a question which wouldn’t be considered in the West until 1657,</p>
<p>387<br>00:28:04,040 –&gt; 00:28:05,920<br>when French mathematician Fermat</p>
<p>388<br>00:28:05,920 –&gt; 00:28:08,600<br>challenged his colleagues with the same problem.</p>
<p>389<br>00:28:08,600 –&gt; 00:28:11,760<br>Little did he know that they’d been beaten to a solution</p>
<p>390<br>00:28:11,760 –&gt; 00:28:14,680<br>by Brahmagupta 1,000 years earlier.</p>
<p>391<br>00:28:20,000 –&gt; 00:28:24,640<br>Brahmagupta was beginning to find abstract ways of solving equations,</p>
<p>392<br>00:28:24,640 –&gt; 00:28:27,800<br>but astonishingly, he was also developing</p>
<p>393<br>00:28:27,800 –&gt; 00:28:31,120<br>a new mathematical language to express that abstraction.</p>
<p>394<br>00:28:32,440 –&gt; 00:28:36,640<br>Brahmagupta was experimenting with ways of writing his equations down,</p>
<p>395<br>00:28:36,640 –&gt; 00:28:40,120<br>using the initials of the names of different colours</p>
<p>396<br>00:28:40,120 –&gt; 00:28:42,680<br>to represent unknowns in his equations.</p>
<p>397<br>00:28:44,640 –&gt; 00:28:47,400<br>A new mathematical language was coming to life,</p>
<p>398<br>00:28:47,400 –&gt; 00:28:49,840<br>which would ultimately lead to the x’s and y’s</p>
<p>399<br>00:28:49,840 –&gt; 00:28:52,880<br>which fill today’s mathematical journals.</p>
<p>400<br>00:29:07,160 –&gt; 00:29:10,840<br>But it wasn’t just new notation that was being developed.</p>
<p>401<br>00:29:13,200 –&gt; 00:29:15,840<br>Indian mathematicians were responsible for making</p>
<p>402<br>00:29:15,840 –&gt; 00:29:19,560<br>fundamental new discoveries in the theory of trigonometry.</p>
<p>403<br>00:29:22,400 –&gt; 00:29:26,640<br>The power of trigonometry is that it acts like a dictionary,</p>
<p>404<br>00:29:26,640 –&gt; 00:29:29,880<br>translating geometry into numbers and back.</p>
<p>405<br>00:29:29,880 –&gt; 00:29:33,120<br>Although first developed by the ancient Greeks,</p>
<p>406<br>00:29:33,120 –&gt; 00:29:35,720<br>it was in the hands of the Indian mathematicians</p>
<p>407<br>00:29:35,720 –&gt; 00:29:37,760<br>that the subject truly flourished.</p>
<p>408<br>00:29:37,760 –&gt; 00:29:42,280<br>At its heart lies the study of right-angled triangles.</p>
<p>409<br>00:29:44,520 –&gt; 00:29:48,000<br>In trigonometry, you can use this angle here</p>
<p>410<br>00:29:48,000 –&gt; 00:29:52,240<br>to find the ratios of the opposite side to the longest side.</p>
<p>411<br>00:29:52,240 –&gt; 00:29:55,000<br>There’s a function called the sine function</p>
<p>412<br>00:29:55,000 –&gt; 00:29:58,040<br>which, when you input the angle, outputs the ratio.</p>
<p>413<br>00:29:58,040 –&gt; 00:30:01,720<br>So for example in this triangle, the angle is about 30 degrees,</p>
<p>414<br>00:30:01,720 –&gt; 00:30:05,720<br>so the output of the sine function is a ratio of one to two,</p>
<p>415<br>00:30:05,720 –&gt; 00:30:10,320<br>telling me that this side is half the length of the longest side.</p>
<p>416<br>00:30:12,800 –&gt; 00:30:16,800<br>The sine function enables you to calculate distances</p>
<p>417<br>00:30:16,800 –&gt; 00:30:21,080<br>when you’re not able to make an accurate measurement.</p>
<p>418<br>00:30:21,080 –&gt; 00:30:25,160<br>To this day, it’s used in architecture and engineering.</p>
<p>419<br>00:30:25,160 –&gt; 00:30:28,000<br>The Indians used it to survey the land around them,</p>
<p>420<br>00:30:28,000 –&gt; 00:30:32,840<br>navigate the seas and, ultimately, chart the depths of space itself.</p>
<p>421<br>00:30:34,800 –&gt; 00:30:37,760<br>It was central to the work of observatories,</p>
<p>422<br>00:30:37,760 –&gt; 00:30:39,600<br>like this one in Delhi,</p>
<p>423<br>00:30:39,600 –&gt; 00:30:42,480<br>where astronomers would study the stars.</p>
<p>424<br>00:30:42,480 –&gt; 00:30:45,000<br>The Indian astronomers could use trigonometry</p>
<p>425<br>00:30:45,000 –&gt; 00:30:48,120<br>to work out the relative distance between Earth and the moon</p>
<p>426<br>00:30:48,120 –&gt; 00:30:49,560<br>and Earth and the sun.</p>
<p>427<br>00:30:49,560 –&gt; 00:30:53,360<br>You can only make the calculation when the moon is half full,</p>
<p>428<br>00:30:53,360 –&gt; 00:30:56,560<br>because that’s when it’s directly opposite the sun,</p>
<p>429<br>00:30:56,560 –&gt; 00:31:01,080<br>so that the sun, moon and Earth create a right-angled triangle.</p>
<p>430<br>00:31:02,640 –&gt; 00:31:04,480<br>Now, the Indians could measure</p>
<p>431<br>00:31:04,480 –&gt; 00:31:07,800<br>that the angle between the sun and the observatory</p>
<p>432<br>00:31:07,800 –&gt; 00:31:09,640<br>was one-seventh of a degree.</p>
<p>433<br>00:31:10,880 –&gt; 00:31:14,160<br>The sine function of one-seventh of a degree</p>
<p>434<br>00:31:14,160 –&gt; 00:31:18,080<br>gives me the ratio of 400:1.</p>
<p>435<br>00:31:18,080 –&gt; 00:31:23,240<br>This means the sun is 400 times further from Earth than the moon is.</p>
<p>436<br>00:31:23,240 –&gt; 00:31:25,120<br>So using trigonometry,</p>
<p>437<br>00:31:25,120 –&gt; 00:31:28,400<br>the Indian mathematicians could explore the solar system</p>
<p>438<br>00:31:28,400 –&gt; 00:31:31,440<br>without ever having to leave the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>439<br>00:31:39,000 –&gt; 00:31:42,600<br>The ancient Greeks had been the first to explore the sine function,</p>
<p>440<br>00:31:42,600 –&gt; 00:31:46,960<br>listing precise values for some angles,</p>
<p>441<br>00:31:46,960 –&gt; 00:31:50,600<br>but they couldn’t calculate the sines of every angle.</p>
<p>442<br>00:31:50,600 –&gt; 00:31:55,120<br>The Indians were to go much further, setting themselves a mammoth task.</p>
<p>443<br>00:31:55,120 –&gt; 00:31:57,200<br>The search was on to find a way</p>
<p>444<br>00:31:57,200 –&gt; 00:32:01,200<br>to calculate the sine function of any angle you might be given.</p>
<p>445<br>00:32:17,920 –&gt; 00:32:21,440<br>The breakthrough in the search for the sine function of every angle</p>
<p>446<br>00:32:21,440 –&gt; 00:32:24,480<br>would be made here in Kerala in south India.</p>
<p>447<br>00:32:24,480 –&gt; 00:32:27,560<br>In the 15th century, this part of the country</p>
<p>448<br>00:32:27,560 –&gt; 00:32:31,360<br>became home to one of the most brilliant schools of mathematicians</p>
<p>449<br>00:32:31,360 –&gt; 00:32:33,160<br>to have ever worked.</p>
<p>450<br>00:32:35,280 –&gt; 00:32:38,560<br>Their leader was called Madhava, and he was to make</p>
<p>451<br>00:32:38,560 –&gt; 00:32:42,320<br>some extraordinary mathematical discoveries.</p>
<p>452<br>00:32:45,120 –&gt; 00:32:49,080<br>The key to Madhava’s success was the concept of the infinite.</p>
<p>453<br>00:32:49,080 –&gt; 00:32:52,680<br>Madhava discovered that you could add up infinitely many things</p>
<p>454<br>00:32:52,680 –&gt; 00:32:54,520<br>with dramatic effects.</p>
<p>455<br>00:32:54,520 –&gt; 00:32:57,840<br>Previous cultures had been nervous of these infinite sums,</p>
<p>456<br>00:32:57,840 –&gt; 00:33:00,320<br>but Madhava was happy to play with them.</p>
<p>457<br>00:33:00,320 –&gt; 00:33:02,880<br>For example, here’s how one can be made up</p>
<p>458<br>00:33:02,880 –&gt; 00:33:05,320<br>by adding infinitely many fractions.</p>
<p>459<br>00:33:06,840 –&gt; 00:33:11,200<br>I’m heading from zero to one on my boat,</p>
<p>460<br>00:33:11,200 –&gt; 00:33:15,440<br>but I can split my journey up into infinitely many fractions.</p>
<p>461<br>00:33:15,440 –&gt; 00:33:18,200<br>So I can get to a half,</p>
<p>462<br>00:33:18,200 –&gt; 00:33:21,920<br>then I can sail on a quarter,</p>
<p>463<br>00:33:21,920 –&gt; 00:33:24,920<br>then an eighth, then a sixteenth, and so on.</p>
<p>464<br>00:33:24,920 –&gt; 00:33:29,320<br>The smaller the fractions I move, the nearer to one I get,</p>
<p>465<br>00:33:29,320 –&gt; 00:33:33,720<br>but I’ll only get there once I’ve added up infinitely many fractions.</p>
<p>466<br>00:33:36,040 –&gt; 00:33:38,160<br>Physically and philosophically,</p>
<p>467<br>00:33:38,160 –&gt; 00:33:41,640<br>it seems rather a challenge to add up infinitely many things,</p>
<p>468<br>00:33:41,640 –&gt; 00:33:45,680<br>but the power of mathematics is to make sense of the impossible.</p>
<p>469<br>00:33:45,680 –&gt; 00:33:47,240<br>By producing a language</p>
<p>470<br>00:33:47,240 –&gt; 00:33:49,600<br>to articulate and manipulate the infinite,</p>
<p>471<br>00:33:49,600 –&gt; 00:33:52,480<br>you can prove that after infinitely many steps</p>
<p>472<br>00:33:52,480 –&gt; 00:33:54,440<br>you’ll reach your destination.</p>
<p>473<br>00:33:57,640 –&gt; 00:34:01,880<br>Such infinite sums are called infinite series, and Madhava</p>
<p>474<br>00:34:01,880 –&gt; 00:34:04,520<br>was doing a lot of research into the connections</p>
<p>475<br>00:34:04,520 –&gt; 00:34:07,560<br>between these series and trigonometry.</p>
<p>476<br>00:34:08,560 –&gt; 00:34:12,200<br>First, he realised that he could use the same principle</p>
<p>477<br>00:34:12,200 –&gt; 00:34:14,840<br>of adding up infinitely many fractions to capture</p>
<p>478<br>00:34:14,840 –&gt; 00:34:19,360<br>one of the most important numbers in mathematics - pi.</p>
<p>479<br>00:34:20,880 –&gt; 00:34:25,680<br>Pi is the ratio of the circle’s circumference to its diameter.</p>
<p>480<br>00:34:25,680 –&gt; 00:34:29,880<br>It’s a number that appears in all sorts of mathematics,</p>
<p>481<br>00:34:29,880 –&gt; 00:34:32,360<br>but is especially useful for engineers,</p>
<p>482<br>00:34:32,360 –&gt; 00:34:36,600<br>because any measurements involving curves soon require pi.</p>
<p>483<br>00:34:38,200 –&gt; 00:34:42,800<br>So for centuries, mathematicians searched for a precise value for pi.</p>
<p>484<br>00:34:48,320 –&gt; 00:34:52,320<br>It was in 6th-century India that the mathematician Aryabhata</p>
<p>485<br>00:34:52,320 –&gt; 00:34:57,160<br>gave a very accurate approximation for pi - namely 3.1416.</p>
<p>486<br>00:34:57,160 –&gt; 00:34:58,840<br>He went on to use this</p>
<p>487<br>00:34:58,840 –&gt; 00:35:02,000<br>to make a measurement of the circumference of the Earth,</p>
<p>488<br>00:35:02,000 –&gt; 00:35:05,480<br>and he got it as 24,835 miles,</p>
<p>489<br>00:35:05,480 –&gt; 00:35:09,800<br>which, amazingly, is only 70 miles away from its true value.</p>
<p>490<br>00:35:09,800 –&gt; 00:35:12,360<br>But it was in Kerala in the 15th century</p>
<p>491<br>00:35:12,360 –&gt; 00:35:15,240<br>that Madhava realised he could use infinity</p>
<p>492<br>00:35:15,240 –&gt; 00:35:17,680<br>to get an exact formula for pi.</p>
<p>493<br>00:35:21,200 –&gt; 00:35:24,800<br>By successively adding and subtracting different fractions,</p>
<p>494<br>00:35:24,800 –&gt; 00:35:28,320<br>Madhava could hone in on an exact formula for pi.</p>
<p>495<br>00:35:30,640 –&gt; 00:35:34,160<br>First, he moved four steps up the number line.</p>
<p>496<br>00:35:34,160 –&gt; 00:35:36,520<br>That took him way past pi.</p>
<p>497<br>00:35:38,040 –&gt; 00:35:41,080<br>So next he took four-thirds of a step,</p>
<p>498<br>00:35:41,080 –&gt; 00:35:44,400<br>or one-and-one-third steps, back.</p>
<p>499<br>00:35:44,400 –&gt; 00:35:46,560<br>Now he’d come too far the other way.</p>
<p>500<br>00:35:47,800 –&gt; 00:35:51,520<br>So he headed forward four-fifths of a step.</p>
<p>501<br>00:35:51,520 –&gt; 00:35:56,320<br>Each time, he alternated between four divided by the next odd number.</p>
<p>502<br>00:36:03,040 –&gt; 00:36:06,160<br>He zigzagged up and down the number line,</p>
<p>503<br>00:36:06,160 –&gt; 00:36:08,640<br>getting closer and closer to pi.</p>
<p>504<br>00:36:08,640 –&gt; 00:36:12,000<br>He discovered that if you went through all the odd numbers,</p>
<p>505<br>00:36:12,000 –&gt; 00:36:15,520<br>infinitely many of them, you would hit pi exactly.</p>
<p>506<br>00:36:19,920 –&gt; 00:36:22,640<br>I was taught at university that this formula for pi</p>
<p>507<br>00:36:22,640 –&gt; 00:36:26,480<br>was discovered by the 17th-century German mathematician Leibniz,</p>
<p>508<br>00:36:26,480 –&gt; 00:36:29,880<br>but amazingly, it was actually discovered here in Kerala</p>
<p>509<br>00:36:29,880 –&gt; 00:36:31,760<br>two centuries earlier by Madhava.</p>
<p>510<br>00:36:31,760 –&gt; 00:36:34,360<br>He went on to use the same sort of mathematics</p>
<p>511<br>00:36:34,360 –&gt; 00:36:36,280<br>to get infinite-series expressions</p>
<p>512<br>00:36:36,280 –&gt; 00:36:38,640<br>for the sine formula in trigonometry.</p>
<p>513<br>00:36:38,640 –&gt; 00:36:42,080<br>And the wonderful thing is that you can use these formulas now</p>
<p>514<br>00:36:42,080 –&gt; 00:36:46,040<br>to calculate the sine of any angle to any degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>515<br>00:36:56,760 –&gt; 00:37:00,520<br>It seems incredible that the Indians made these discoveries</p>
<p>516<br>00:37:00,520 –&gt; 00:37:03,400<br>centuries before Western mathematicians.</p>
<p>517<br>00:37:06,160 –&gt; 00:37:10,760<br>And it says a lot about our attitude in the West to non-Western cultures</p>
<p>518<br>00:37:10,760 –&gt; 00:37:14,720<br>that we nearly always claim their discoveries as our own.</p>
<p>519<br>00:37:14,720 –&gt; 00:37:18,760<br>What is clear is the West has been very slow to give due credit</p>
<p>520<br>00:37:18,760 –&gt; 00:37:22,320<br>to the major breakthroughs made in non-Western mathematics.</p>
<p>521<br>00:37:22,320 –&gt; 00:37:25,520<br>Madhava wasn’t the only mathematician to suffer this way.</p>
<p>522<br>00:37:25,520 –&gt; 00:37:28,600<br>As the West came into contact more and more with the East</p>
<p>523<br>00:37:28,600 –&gt; 00:37:30,480<br>during the 18th and 19th centuries,</p>
<p>524<br>00:37:30,480 –&gt; 00:37:33,120<br>there was a widespread dismissal and denigration</p>
<p>525<br>00:37:33,120 –&gt; 00:37:35,200<br>of the cultures they were colonising.</p>
<p>526<br>00:37:35,200 –&gt; 00:37:38,000<br>The natives, it was assumed, couldn’t have anything</p>
<p>527<br>00:37:38,000 –&gt; 00:37:40,240<br>of intellectual worth to offer the West.</p>
<p>528<br>00:37:40,240 –&gt; 00:37:43,160<br>It’s only now, at the beginning of the 21st century,</p>
<p>529<br>00:37:43,160 –&gt; 00:37:45,880<br>that history is being rewritten.</p>
<p>530<br>00:37:45,880 –&gt; 00:37:49,880<br>But Eastern mathematics was to have a major impact in Europe,</p>
<p>531<br>00:37:49,880 –&gt; 00:37:53,040<br>thanks to the development of one of the major powers</p>
<p>532<br>00:37:53,040 –&gt; 00:37:54,720<br>of the medieval world.</p>
<p>533<br>00:38:17,440 –&gt; 00:38:20,960<br>In the 7th century, a new empire began to spread</p>
<p>534<br>00:38:20,960 –&gt; 00:38:23,200<br>across the Middle East.</p>
<p>535<br>00:38:23,200 –&gt; 00:38:25,680<br>The teachings of the Prophet Mohammed</p>
<p>536<br>00:38:25,680 –&gt; 00:38:28,560<br>inspired a vast and powerful Islamic empire</p>
<p>537<br>00:38:28,560 –&gt; 00:38:30,920<br>which soon stretched from India in the east</p>
<p>538<br>00:38:30,920 –&gt; 00:38:35,160<br>to here in Morocco in the west.</p>
<p>539<br>00:38:41,960 –&gt; 00:38:46,480<br>And at the heart of this empire lay a vibrant intellectual culture.</p>
<p>540<br>00:38:51,400 –&gt; 00:38:56,160<br>A great library and centre of learning was established in Baghdad.</p>
<p>541<br>00:38:56,160 –&gt; 00:38:59,640<br>Called the House of Wisdom, its teaching spread</p>
<p>542<br>00:38:59,640 –&gt; 00:39:01,840<br>throughout the Islamic empire,</p>
<p>543<br>00:39:01,840 –&gt; 00:39:05,080<br>reaching schools like this one here in Fez.</p>
<p>544<br>00:39:05,080 –&gt; 00:39:08,360<br>Subjects studied included astronomy, medicine,</p>
<p>545<br>00:39:08,360 –&gt; 00:39:10,240<br>chemistry, zoology</p>
<p>546<br>00:39:10,240 –&gt; 00:39:11,920<br>and mathematics.</p>
<p>547<br>00:39:13,480 –&gt; 00:39:18,160<br>The Muslim scholars collected and translated many ancient texts,</p>
<p>548<br>00:39:18,160 –&gt; 00:39:20,600<br>effectively saving them for posterity.</p>
<p>549<br>00:39:20,600 –&gt; 00:39:23,880<br>In fact, without their intervention, we may never have known</p>
<p>550<br>00:39:23,880 –&gt; 00:39:27,480<br>about the ancient cultures of Egypt, Babylon, Greece and India.</p>
<p>551<br>00:39:27,480 –&gt; 00:39:30,440<br>But the scholars at the House of Wisdom weren’t content</p>
<p>552<br>00:39:30,440 –&gt; 00:39:33,360<br>simply with translating other people’s mathematics.</p>
<p>553<br>00:39:33,360 –&gt; 00:39:36,080<br>They wanted to create a mathematics of their own,</p>
<p>554<br>00:39:36,080 –&gt; 00:39:37,920<br>to push the subject forward.</p>
<p>555<br>00:39:42,080 –&gt; 00:39:46,080<br>Such intellectual curiosity was actively encouraged</p>
<p>556<br>00:39:46,080 –&gt; 00:39:49,320<br>in the early centuries of the Islamic empire.</p>
<p>557<br>00:39:51,320 –&gt; 00:39:54,880<br>The Koran asserted the importance of knowledge.</p>
<p>558<br>00:39:54,880 –&gt; 00:39:58,640<br>Learning was nothing less than a requirement of God.</p>
<p>559<br>00:40:01,720 –&gt; 00:40:05,400<br>In fact, the needs of Islam demanded mathematical skill.</p>
<p>560<br>00:40:05,400 –&gt; 00:40:07,920<br>The devout needed to calculate the time of prayer</p>
<p>561<br>00:40:07,920 –&gt; 00:40:10,640<br>and the direction of Mecca to pray towards,</p>
<p>562<br>00:40:10,640 –&gt; 00:40:13,640<br>and the prohibition of depicting the human form</p>
<p>563<br>00:40:13,640 –&gt; 00:40:15,520<br>meant that they had to use</p>
<p>564<br>00:40:15,520 –&gt; 00:40:18,520<br>much more geometric patterns to cover their buildings.</p>
<p>565<br>00:40:18,520 –&gt; 00:40:22,080<br>The Muslim artists discovered all the different sorts of symmetry</p>
<p>566<br>00:40:22,080 –&gt; 00:40:26,320<br>that you can depict on a two-dimensional wall.</p>
<p>567<br>00:40:34,000 –&gt; 00:40:37,040<br>The director of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad</p>
<p>568<br>00:40:37,040 –&gt; 00:40:40,400<br>was a Persian scholar called Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi.</p>
<p>569<br>00:40:43,520 –&gt; 00:40:48,440<br>Al-Khwarizmi was an exceptional mathematician who was responsible</p>
<p>570<br>00:40:48,440 –&gt; 00:40:52,680<br>for introducing two key mathematical concepts to the West.</p>
<p>571<br>00:40:52,680 –&gt; 00:40:55,680<br>Al-Khwarizmi recognised the incredible potential</p>
<p>572<br>00:40:55,680 –&gt; 00:40:57,520<br>that the Hindu numerals had</p>
<p>573<br>00:40:57,520 –&gt; 00:41:00,480<br>to revolutionise mathematics and science.</p>
<p>574<br>00:41:00,480 –&gt; 00:41:03,040<br>His work explaining the power of these numbers</p>
<p>575<br>00:41:03,040 –&gt; 00:41:06,000<br>to speed up calculations and do things effectively</p>
<p>576<br>00:41:06,000 –&gt; 00:41:09,400<br>was so influential that it wasn’t long before they were adopted</p>
<p>577<br>00:41:09,400 –&gt; 00:41:13,240<br>as the numbers of choice amongst the mathematicians of the Islamic world.</p>
<p>578<br>00:41:13,240 –&gt; 00:41:16,000<br>In fact, these numbers have now become known</p>
<p>579<br>00:41:16,000 –&gt; 00:41:18,320<br>as the Hindu-Arabic numerals.</p>
<p>580<br>00:41:18,320 –&gt; 00:41:21,360<br>These numbers - one to nine and zero -</p>
<p>581<br>00:41:21,360 –&gt; 00:41:25,160<br>are the ones we use today all over the world.</p>
<p>582<br>00:41:29,680 –&gt; 00:41:34,640<br>But Al-Khwarizmi was to create a whole new mathematical language.</p>
<p>583<br>00:41:36,280 –&gt; 00:41:38,240<br>It was called algebra</p>
<p>584<br>00:41:38,240 –&gt; 00:41:42,760<br>and was named after the title of his book Al-jabr W’al-muqabala,</p>
<p>585<br>00:41:42,760 –&gt; 00:41:46,120<br>or Calculation By Restoration Or Reduction.</p>
<p>586<br>00:41:50,960 –&gt; 00:41:56,080<br>Algebra is the grammar that underlies the way that numbers work.</p>
<p>587<br>00:41:56,080 –&gt; 00:41:58,480<br>It’s a language that explains the patterns</p>
<p>588<br>00:41:58,480 –&gt; 00:42:01,640<br>that lie behind the behaviour of numbers.</p>
<p>589<br>00:42:01,640 –&gt; 00:42:05,560<br>It’s a bit like a code for running a computer program.</p>
<p>590<br>00:42:05,560 –&gt; 00:42:09,240<br>The code will work whatever the numbers you feed in to the program.</p>
<p>591<br>00:42:11,040 –&gt; 00:42:14,680<br>For example, mathematicians might have discovered</p>
<p>592<br>00:42:14,680 –&gt; 00:42:16,960<br>that if you take a number and square it,</p>
<p>593<br>00:42:16,960 –&gt; 00:42:19,240<br>that’s always one more than if you’d taken</p>
<p>594<br>00:42:19,240 –&gt; 00:42:22,240<br>the numbers either side and multiplied those together.</p>
<p>595<br>00:42:22,240 –&gt; 00:42:25,440<br>For example, five times five is 25,</p>
<p>596<br>00:42:25,440 –&gt; 00:42:29,360<br>which is one more than four times six - 24.</p>
<p>597<br>00:42:29,360 –&gt; 00:42:33,160<br>Six times six is always one more than five times seven and so on.</p>
<p>598<br>00:42:33,160 –&gt; 00:42:34,880<br>But how can you be sure</p>
<p>599<br>00:42:34,880 –&gt; 00:42:38,080<br>that this is going to work whatever numbers you take?</p>
<p>600<br>00:42:38,080 –&gt; 00:42:41,040<br>To explain the pattern underlying these calculations,</p>
<p>601<br>00:42:41,040 –&gt; 00:42:43,320<br>let’s use the dyeing holes in this tannery.</p>
<p>602<br>00:42:51,280 –&gt; 00:42:56,520<br>If we take a square of 25 holes, running five by five,</p>
<p>603<br>00:42:56,520 –&gt; 00:43:00,760<br>and take one row of five away and add it to the bottom,</p>
<p>604<br>00:43:00,760 –&gt; 00:43:03,640<br>we get six by four with one left over.</p>
<p>605<br>00:43:05,880 –&gt; 00:43:09,440<br>But however many holes there are on the side of the square,</p>
<p>606<br>00:43:09,440 –&gt; 00:43:12,320<br>we can always move one row of holes down in a similar way</p>
<p>607<br>00:43:12,320 –&gt; 00:43:16,240<br>to be left with a rectangle of holes with one left over.</p>
<p>608<br>00:43:18,880 –&gt; 00:43:20,960<br>Algebra was a huge breakthrough.</p>
<p>609<br>00:43:20,960 –&gt; 00:43:22,680<br>Here was a new language</p>
<p>610<br>00:43:22,680 –&gt; 00:43:25,720<br>to be able to analyse the way that numbers worked.</p>
<p>611<br>00:43:25,720 –&gt; 00:43:27,880<br>Previously, the Indians and the Chinese</p>
<p>612<br>00:43:27,880 –&gt; 00:43:30,120<br>had considered very specific problems,</p>
<p>613<br>00:43:30,120 –&gt; 00:43:33,600<br>but Al-Khwarizmi went from the specific to the general.</p>
<p>614<br>00:43:33,600 –&gt; 00:43:37,200<br>He developed systematic ways to be able to analyse problems</p>
<p>615<br>00:43:37,200 –&gt; 00:43:40,800<br>so that the solutions would work whatever the numbers that you took.</p>
<p>616<br>00:43:40,800 –&gt; 00:43:44,560<br>This language is used across the mathematical world today.</p>
<p>617<br>00:43:46,080 –&gt; 00:43:50,800<br>Al-Khwarizmi’s great breakthrough came when he applied algebra</p>
<p>618<br>00:43:50,800 –&gt; 00:43:52,480<br>to quadratic equations -</p>
<p>619<br>00:43:52,480 –&gt; 00:43:55,560<br>that is equations including numbers to the power of two.</p>
<p>620<br>00:43:55,560 –&gt; 00:43:58,360<br>The ancient Mesopotamians had devised</p>
<p>621<br>00:43:58,360 –&gt; 00:44:02,120<br>a cunning method to solve particular quadratic equations,</p>
<p>622<br>00:44:02,120 –&gt; 00:44:06,240<br>but it was Al-Khwarizmi’s abstract language of algebra</p>
<p>623<br>00:44:06,240 –&gt; 00:44:10,000<br>that could finally express why this method always worked.</p>
<p>624<br>00:44:11,600 –&gt; 00:44:14,200<br>This was a great conceptual leap</p>
<p>625<br>00:44:14,200 –&gt; 00:44:17,920<br>and would ultimately lead to a formula that could be used to solve</p>
<p>626<br>00:44:17,920 –&gt; 00:44:22,160<br>any quadratic equation, whatever the numbers involved.</p>
<p>627<br>00:44:30,480 –&gt; 00:44:32,440<br>The next mathematical Holy Grail</p>
<p>628<br>00:44:32,440 –&gt; 00:44:37,040<br>was to find a general method that could solve all cubic equations -</p>
<p>629<br>00:44:37,040 –&gt; 00:44:40,640<br>equations including numbers to the power of three.</p>
<p>630<br>00:44:57,920 –&gt; 00:45:00,640<br>It was an 11th-century Persian mathematician</p>
<p>631<br>00:45:00,640 –&gt; 00:45:04,000<br>who took up the challenge of cracking the problem of the cubic.</p>
<p>632<br>00:45:08,440 –&gt; 00:45:11,960<br>His name was Omar Khayyam, and he travelled widely</p>
<p>633<br>00:45:11,960 –&gt; 00:45:15,600<br>across the Middle East, calculating as he went.</p>
<p>634<br>00:45:17,520 –&gt; 00:45:21,440<br>But he was famous for another, very different, reason.</p>
<p>635<br>00:45:21,440 –&gt; 00:45:24,080<br>Khayyam was a celebrated poet,</p>
<p>636<br>00:45:24,080 –&gt; 00:45:28,040<br>author of the great epic poem the Rubaiyat.</p>
<p>637<br>00:45:30,920 –&gt; 00:45:35,120<br>It may seem a bit odd that a poet was also a master mathematician.</p>
<p>638<br>00:45:35,120 –&gt; 00:45:38,560<br>After all, the combination doesn’t immediately spring to mind.</p>
<p>639<br>00:45:38,560 –&gt; 00:45:42,200<br>But there’s quite a lot of similarity between the disciplines.</p>
<p>640<br>00:45:42,200 –&gt; 00:45:45,560<br>Poetry, with its rhyming structure and rhythmic patterns,</p>
<p>641<br>00:45:45,560 –&gt; 00:45:49,520<br>resonates strongly with constructing a logical mathematical proof.</p>
<p>642<br>00:45:53,000 –&gt; 00:45:55,320<br>Khayyam’s major mathematical work</p>
<p>643<br>00:45:55,320 –&gt; 00:46:02,040<br>was devoted to finding the general method to solve all cubic equations.</p>
<p>644<br>00:46:02,040 –&gt; 00:46:04,600<br>Rather than looking at particular examples,</p>
<p>645<br>00:46:04,600 –&gt; 00:46:08,640<br>Khayyam carried out a systematic analysis of the problem,</p>
<p>646<br>00:46:08,640 –&gt; 00:46:11,920<br>true to the algebraic spirit of Al-Khwarizmi.</p>
<p>647<br>00:46:13,760 –&gt; 00:46:16,280<br>Khayyam’s analysis revealed for the first time</p>
<p>648<br>00:46:16,280 –&gt; 00:46:19,480<br>that there were several different sorts of cubic equation.</p>
<p>649<br>00:46:19,480 –&gt; 00:46:21,560<br>But he was still very influenced</p>
<p>650<br>00:46:21,560 –&gt; 00:46:24,320<br>by the geometric heritage of the Greeks.</p>
<p>651<br>00:46:24,320 –&gt; 00:46:27,080<br>He couldn’t separate the algebra from the geometry.</p>
<p>652<br>00:46:27,080 –&gt; 00:46:30,440<br>In fact, he wouldn’t even consider equations in higher degrees,</p>
<p>653<br>00:46:30,440 –&gt; 00:46:33,840<br>because they described objects in more than three dimensions,</p>
<p>654<br>00:46:33,840 –&gt; 00:46:35,640<br>something he saw as impossible.</p>
<p>655<br>00:46:35,640 –&gt; 00:46:37,520<br>Although the geometry allowed him</p>
<p>656<br>00:46:37,520 –&gt; 00:46:40,120<br>to analyse these cubic equations to some extent,</p>
<p>657<br>00:46:40,120 –&gt; 00:46:43,280<br>he still couldn’t come up with a purely algebraic solution.</p>
<p>658<br>00:46:45,800 –&gt; 00:46:51,400<br>It would be another 500 years before mathematicians could make the leap</p>
<p>659<br>00:46:51,400 –&gt; 00:46:54,720<br>and find a general solution to the cubic equation.</p>
<p>660<br>00:46:56,240 –&gt; 00:47:01,400<br>And that leap would finally be made in the West - in Italy.</p>
<p>661<br>00:47:15,400 –&gt; 00:47:18,880<br>During the centuries in which China, India and the Islamic empire</p>
<p>662<br>00:47:18,880 –&gt; 00:47:20,520<br>had been in the ascendant,</p>
<p>663<br>00:47:20,520 –&gt; 00:47:24,760<br>Europe had fallen under the shadow of the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>664<br>00:47:26,280 –&gt; 00:47:30,560<br>All intellectual life, including the study of mathematics, had stagnated.</p>
<p>665<br>00:47:35,760 –&gt; 00:47:41,400<br>But by the 13th century, things were beginning to change.</p>
<p>666<br>00:47:41,400 –&gt; 00:47:46,680<br>Led by Italy, Europe was starting to explore and trade with the East.</p>
<p>667<br>00:47:46,680 –&gt; 00:47:51,120<br>With that contact came the spread of Eastern knowledge to the West.</p>
<p>668<br>00:47:51,120 –&gt; 00:47:53,120<br>It was the son of a customs official</p>
<p>669<br>00:47:53,120 –&gt; 00:47:56,640<br>that would become Europe’s first great medieval mathematician.</p>
<p>670<br>00:47:56,640 –&gt; 00:48:00,240<br>As a child, he travelled around North Africa with his father,</p>
<p>671<br>00:48:00,240 –&gt; 00:48:03,440<br>where he learnt about the developments of Arabic mathematics</p>
<p>672<br>00:48:03,440 –&gt; 00:48:06,720<br>and especially the benefits of the Hindu-Arabic numerals.</p>
<p>673<br>00:48:06,720 –&gt; 00:48:08,760<br>When he got home to Italy he wrote a book</p>
<p>674<br>00:48:08,760 –&gt; 00:48:10,640<br>that would be hugely influential</p>
<p>675<br>00:48:10,640 –&gt; 00:48:13,240<br>in the development of Western mathematics.</p>
<p>676<br>00:48:29,320 –&gt; 00:48:31,800<br>That mathematician was Leonardo of Pisa,</p>
<p>677<br>00:48:31,800 –&gt; 00:48:34,440<br>better known as Fibonacci,</p>
<p>678<br>00:48:35,480 –&gt; 00:48:37,920<br>and in his Book Of Calculating,</p>
<p>679<br>00:48:37,920 –&gt; 00:48:40,720<br>Fibonacci promoted the new number system,</p>
<p>680<br>00:48:40,720 –&gt; 00:48:44,080<br>demonstrating how simple it was compared to the Roman numerals</p>
<p>681<br>00:48:44,080 –&gt; 00:48:47,560<br>that were in use across Europe.</p>
<p>682<br>00:48:47,560 –&gt; 00:48:52,640<br>Calculations were far easier, a fact that had huge consequences</p>
<p>683<br>00:48:52,640 –&gt; 00:48:55,080<br>for anyone dealing with numbers -</p>
<p>684<br>00:48:55,080 –&gt; 00:48:59,920<br>pretty much everyone, from mathematicians to merchants.</p>
<p>685<br>00:48:59,920 –&gt; 00:49:02,640<br>But there was widespread suspicion of these new numbers.</p>
<p>686<br>00:49:02,640 –&gt; 00:49:06,320<br>Old habits die hard, and the authorities just didn’t trust them.</p>
<p>687<br>00:49:06,320 –&gt; 00:49:09,200<br>Some believed that they would be more open to fraud -</p>
<p>688<br>00:49:09,200 –&gt; 00:49:11,040<br>that you could tamper with them.</p>
<p>689<br>00:49:11,040 –&gt; 00:49:14,520<br>Others believed that they’d be so easy to use for calculations</p>
<p>690<br>00:49:14,520 –&gt; 00:49:17,800<br>that it would empower the masses, taking authority away</p>
<p>691<br>00:49:17,800 –&gt; 00:49:21,800<br>from the intelligentsia who knew how to use the old sort of numbers.</p>
<p>692<br>00:49:27,200 –&gt; 00:49:31,200<br>The city of Florence even banned them in 1299,</p>
<p>693<br>00:49:31,200 –&gt; 00:49:34,400<br>but over time, common sense prevailed,</p>
<p>694<br>00:49:34,400 –&gt; 00:49:37,200<br>the new system spread throughout Europe,</p>
<p>695<br>00:49:37,200 –&gt; 00:49:40,960<br>and the old Roman system slowly became defunct.</p>
<p>696<br>00:49:40,960 –&gt; 00:49:46,440<br>At last, the Hindu-Arabic numerals, zero to nine, had triumphed.</p>
<p>697<br>00:49:48,360 –&gt; 00:49:51,720<br>Today Fibonacci is best known for the discovery of some numbers,</p>
<p>698<br>00:49:51,720 –&gt; 00:49:55,200<br>now called the Fibonacci sequence, that arose when he was trying</p>
<p>699<br>00:49:55,200 –&gt; 00:49:58,240<br>to solve a riddle about the mating habits of rabbits.</p>
<p>700<br>00:49:58,240 –&gt; 00:50:01,040<br>Suppose a farmer has a pair of rabbits.</p>
<p>701<br>00:50:01,040 –&gt; 00:50:03,520<br>Rabbits take two months to reach maturity,</p>
<p>702<br>00:50:03,520 –&gt; 00:50:07,240<br>and after that they give birth to another pair of rabbits each month.</p>
<p>703<br>00:50:07,240 –&gt; 00:50:09,080<br>So the problem was how to determine</p>
<p>704<br>00:50:09,080 –&gt; 00:50:12,560<br>how many pairs of rabbits there will be in any given month.</p>
<p>705<br>00:50:14,800 –&gt; 00:50:20,000<br>Well, during the first month you have one pair of rabbits,</p>
<p>706<br>00:50:20,000 –&gt; 00:50:24,200<br>and since they haven’t matured, they can’t reproduce.</p>
<p>707<br>00:50:24,200 –&gt; 00:50:28,400<br>During the second month, there is still only one pair.</p>
<p>708<br>00:50:28,400 –&gt; 00:50:32,000<br>But at the beginning of the third month, the first pair</p>
<p>709<br>00:50:32,000 –&gt; 00:50:36,400<br>reproduces for the first time, so there are two pairs of rabbits.</p>
<p>710<br>00:50:36,400 –&gt; 00:50:38,720<br>At the beginning of the fourth month,</p>
<p>711<br>00:50:38,720 –&gt; 00:50:40,800<br>the first pair reproduces again,</p>
<p>712<br>00:50:40,800 –&gt; 00:50:45,160<br>but the second pair is not mature enough, so there are three pairs.</p>
<p>713<br>00:50:46,840 –&gt; 00:50:50,000<br>In the fifth month, the first pair reproduces</p>
<p>714<br>00:50:50,000 –&gt; 00:50:53,480<br>and the second pair reproduces for the first time,</p>
<p>715<br>00:50:53,480 –&gt; 00:50:58,200<br>but the third pair is still too young, so there are five pairs.</p>
<p>716<br>00:50:58,200 –&gt; 00:51:00,120<br>The mating ritual continues,</p>
<p>717<br>00:51:00,120 –&gt; 00:51:02,240<br>but what you soon realise is</p>
<p>718<br>00:51:02,240 –&gt; 00:51:05,760<br>the number of pairs of rabbits you have in any given month</p>
<p>719<br>00:51:05,760 –&gt; 00:51:09,400<br>is the sum of the pairs of rabbits that you have had</p>
<p>720<br>00:51:09,400 –&gt; 00:51:13,120<br>in each of the two previous months, so the sequence goes…</p>
<p>721<br>00:51:13,120 –&gt; 00:51:17,280<br>1…1…2…3…</p>
<p>722<br>00:51:17,280 –&gt; 00:51:21,120<br>5…8…13…</p>
<p>723<br>00:51:21,120 –&gt; 00:51:26,640<br>21…34…55…and so on.</p>
<p>724<br>00:51:26,640 –&gt; 00:51:29,680<br>The Fibonacci numbers are nature’s favourite numbers.</p>
<p>725<br>00:51:29,680 –&gt; 00:51:31,600<br>It’s not just rabbits that use them.</p>
<p>726<br>00:51:31,600 –&gt; 00:51:35,880<br>The number of petals on a flower is invariably a Fibonacci number.</p>
<p>727<br>00:51:35,880 –&gt; 00:51:39,960<br>They run up and down pineapples if you count the segments.</p>
<p>728<br>00:51:39,960 –&gt; 00:51:42,960<br>Even snails use them to grow their shells.</p>
<p>729<br>00:51:42,960 –&gt; 00:51:46,920<br>Wherever you find growth in nature, you find the Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>730<br>00:51:51,560 –&gt; 00:51:54,880<br>But the next major breakthrough in European mathematics</p>
<p>731<br>00:51:54,880 –&gt; 00:51:58,800<br>wouldn’t happen until the early 16th century.</p>
<p>732<br>00:51:58,800 –&gt; 00:52:00,800<br>It would involve</p>
<p>733<br>00:52:00,800 –&gt; 00:52:04,240<br>finding the general method that would solve all cubic equations,</p>
<p>734<br>00:52:04,240 –&gt; 00:52:08,880<br>and it would happen here in the Italian city of Bologna.</p>
<p>735<br>00:52:10,600 –&gt; 00:52:14,040<br>The University of Bologna was the crucible</p>
<p>736<br>00:52:14,040 –&gt; 00:52:17,560<br>of European mathematical thought at the beginning of the 16th century.</p>
<p>737<br>00:52:20,880 –&gt; 00:52:24,720<br>Pupils from all over Europe flocked here and developed</p>
<p>738<br>00:52:24,720 –&gt; 00:52:29,440<br>a new form of spectator sport - the mathematical competition.</p>
<p>739<br>00:52:31,120 –&gt; 00:52:34,480<br>Large audiences would gather to watch mathematicians</p>
<p>740<br>00:52:34,480 –&gt; 00:52:39,680<br>challenge each other with numbers, a kind of intellectual fencing match.</p>
<p>741<br>00:52:39,680 –&gt; 00:52:42,920<br>But even in this questioning atmosphere</p>
<p>742<br>00:52:42,920 –&gt; 00:52:46,400<br>it was believed that some problems were just unsolvable.</p>
<p>743<br>00:52:46,400 –&gt; 00:52:51,120<br>It was generally assumed that finding a general method</p>
<p>744<br>00:52:51,120 –&gt; 00:52:54,760<br>to solve all cubic equations was impossible.</p>
<p>745<br>00:52:54,760 –&gt; 00:52:58,560<br>But one scholar was to prove everyone wrong.</p>
<p>746<br>00:53:01,200 –&gt; 00:53:03,040<br>His name was Tartaglia,</p>
<p>747<br>00:53:03,040 –&gt; 00:53:05,040<br>but he certainly didn’t look</p>
<p>748<br>00:53:05,040 –&gt; 00:53:08,000<br>the heroic architect of a new mathematics.</p>
<p>749<br>00:53:08,000 –&gt; 00:53:11,160<br>At the age of 12, he’d been slashed across the face</p>
<p>750<br>00:53:11,160 –&gt; 00:53:13,720<br>with a sabre by a rampaging French army.</p>
<p>751<br>00:53:13,720 –&gt; 00:53:16,320<br>The result was a terrible facial scar</p>
<p>752<br>00:53:16,320 –&gt; 00:53:19,000<br>and a devastating speech impediment.</p>
<p>753<br>00:53:19,000 –&gt; 00:53:22,880<br>In fact, Tartaglia was the nickname he’d been given as a child</p>
<p>754<br>00:53:22,880 –&gt; 00:53:24,800<br>and means “the stammerer”.</p>
<p>755<br>00:53:30,040 –&gt; 00:53:33,360<br>Shunned by his schoolmates,</p>
<p>756<br>00:53:33,360 –&gt; 00:53:37,960<br>Tartaglia lost himself in mathematics, and it wasn’t long</p>
<p>757<br>00:53:37,960 –&gt; 00:53:43,080<br>before he’d found the formula to solve one type of cubic equation.</p>
<p>758<br>00:53:43,080 –&gt; 00:53:45,040<br>But Tartaglia soon discovered</p>
<p>759<br>00:53:45,040 –&gt; 00:53:48,640<br>that he wasn’t the only one to believe he’d cracked the cubic.</p>
<p>760<br>00:53:48,640 –&gt; 00:53:51,840<br>A young Italian called Fior was boasting</p>
<p>761<br>00:53:51,840 –&gt; 00:53:57,000<br>that he too held the secret formula for solving cubic equations.</p>
<p>762<br>00:53:57,000 –&gt; 00:53:59,840<br>When news broke about the discoveries</p>
<p>763<br>00:53:59,840 –&gt; 00:54:02,440<br>made by the two mathematicians,</p>
<p>764<br>00:54:02,440 –&gt; 00:54:06,360<br>a competition was arranged to pit them against each other.</p>
<p>765<br>00:54:06,360 –&gt; 00:54:10,320<br>The intellectual fencing match of the century was about to begin.</p>
<p>766<br>00:54:17,840 –&gt; 00:54:19,880<br>The trouble was that Tartaglia</p>
<p>767<br>00:54:19,880 –&gt; 00:54:22,800<br>only knew how to solve one sort of cubic equation,</p>
<p>768<br>00:54:22,800 –&gt; 00:54:24,800<br>and Fior was ready to challenge him</p>
<p>769<br>00:54:24,800 –&gt; 00:54:27,120<br>with questions about a different sort.</p>
<p>770<br>00:54:27,120 –&gt; 00:54:29,480<br>But just a few days before the contest,</p>
<p>771<br>00:54:29,480 –&gt; 00:54:32,520<br>Tartaglia worked out how to solve this different sort,</p>
<p>772<br>00:54:32,520 –&gt; 00:54:35,880<br>and with this new weapon in his arsenal he thrashed his opponent,</p>
<p>773<br>00:54:35,880 –&gt; 00:54:38,240<br>solving all the questions in under two hours.</p>
<p>774<br>00:54:41,840 –&gt; 00:54:44,080<br>Tartaglia went on</p>
<p>775<br>00:54:44,080 –&gt; 00:54:48,000<br>to find the formula to solve all types of cubic equations.</p>
<p>776<br>00:54:48,000 –&gt; 00:54:51,040<br>News soon spread, and a mathematician in Milan</p>
<p>777<br>00:54:51,040 –&gt; 00:54:54,800<br>called Cardano became so desperate to find the solution</p>
<p>778<br>00:54:54,800 –&gt; 00:54:59,360<br>that he persuaded a reluctant Tartaglia to reveal the secret,</p>
<p>779<br>00:54:59,360 –&gt; 00:55:01,200<br>but on one condition -</p>
<p>780<br>00:55:01,200 –&gt; 00:55:05,000<br>that Cardano keep the secret and never publish.</p>
<p>781<br>00:55:07,760 –&gt; 00:55:09,600<br>But Cardano couldn’t resist</p>
<p>782<br>00:55:09,600 –&gt; 00:55:14,000<br>discussing Tartaglia’s solution with his brilliant student, Ferrari.</p>
<p>783<br>00:55:14,000 –&gt; 00:55:16,880<br>As Ferrari got to grips with Tartaglia’s work,</p>
<p>784<br>00:55:16,880 –&gt; 00:55:19,120<br>he realised that he could use it to solve</p>
<p>785<br>00:55:19,120 –&gt; 00:55:22,720<br>the more complicated quartic equation, an amazing achievement.</p>
<p>786<br>00:55:22,720 –&gt; 00:55:25,920<br>Cardano couldn’t deny his student his just rewards,</p>
<p>787<br>00:55:25,920 –&gt; 00:55:29,280<br>and he broke his vow of secrecy, publishing Tartaglia’s work</p>
<p>788<br>00:55:29,280 –&gt; 00:55:32,720<br>together with Ferrari’s brilliant solution of the quartic.</p>
<p>789<br>00:55:35,120 –&gt; 00:55:39,080<br>Poor Tartaglia never recovered and died penniless,</p>
<p>790<br>00:55:39,080 –&gt; 00:55:42,600<br>and to this day, the formula that solves the cubic equation</p>
<p>791<br>00:55:42,600 –&gt; 00:55:45,240<br>is known as Cardano’s formula.</p>
<p>792<br>00:55:54,040 –&gt; 00:55:57,520<br>Tartaglia may not have won glory in his lifetime,</p>
<p>793<br>00:55:57,520 –&gt; 00:56:01,200<br>but his mathematics managed to solve a problem that had bewildered</p>
<p>794<br>00:56:01,200 –&gt; 00:56:05,720<br>the great mathematicians of China, India and the Arab world.</p>
<p>795<br>00:56:07,920 –&gt; 00:56:11,440<br>It was the first great mathematical breakthrough</p>
<p>796<br>00:56:11,440 –&gt; 00:56:13,440<br>to happen in modern Europe.</p>
<p>797<br>00:56:17,520 –&gt; 00:56:20,880<br>The Europeans now had in their hands the new language of algebra,</p>
<p>798<br>00:56:20,880 –&gt; 00:56:24,120<br>the powerful techniques of the Hindu-Arabic numerals</p>
<p>799<br>00:56:24,120 –&gt; 00:56:27,120<br>and the beginnings of the mastery of the infinite.</p>
<p>800<br>00:56:27,120 –&gt; 00:56:28,920<br>It was time for the Western world</p>
<p>801<br>00:56:28,920 –&gt; 00:56:31,400<br>to start writing its own mathematical stories</p>
<p>802<br>00:56:31,400 –&gt; 00:56:33,040<br>in the language of the East.</p>
<p>803<br>00:56:33,040 –&gt; 00:56:35,920<br>The mathematical revolution was about to begin.</p>
