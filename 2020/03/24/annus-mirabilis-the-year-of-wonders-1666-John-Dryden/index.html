<p>The year of wonders, 1666.</p>
<p>by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dryden">John Dryden</a></p>
<p>  1<br>    In thriving arts long time had Holland grown,<br>       Crouching at home and cruel when abroad:<br>     Scarce leaving us the means to claim our own;<br>       Our King they courted, and our merchants awed.</p>
<p>  2<br>    Trade, which, like blood, should circularly flow,<br>       Stopp’d in their channels, found its freedom lost:<br>     Thither the wealth of all the world did go,<br>       And seem’d but shipwreck’d on so base a coast.</p>
<p>  3<br>    For them alone the heavens had kindly heat;<br>       In eastern quarries ripening precious dew:<br>     For them the Idumæan balm did sweat,<br>       And in hot Ceylon spicy forests grew.</p>
<p>  4<br>    The sun but seem’d the labourer of the year;<br>       Each waxing moon supplied her watery store,<br>     To swell those tides, which from the line did bear<br>       Their brimful vessels to the Belgian shore.</p>
<p>  5<br>    Thus mighty in her ships, stood Carthage long,<br>       And swept the riches of the world from far;<br>     Yet stoop’d to Rome, less wealthy, but more strong:<br>       And this may prove our second Punic war.</p>
<p>  6<br>    What peace can be, where both to one pretend?<br>       (But they more diligent, and we more strong)<br>     Or if a peace, it soon must have an end;<br>       For they would grow too powerful, were it long.</p>
<p>  7<br>    Behold two nations, then, engaged so far<br>       That each seven years the fit must shake each land:<br>     Where France will side to weaken us by war,<br>       Who only can his vast designs withstand.</p>
<p>  8<br>    See how he feeds the Iberian with delays,<br>       To render us his timely friendship vain:<br>     And while his secret soul on Flanders preys,<br>       He rocks the cradle of the babe of Spain.</p>
<p>  9<br>    Such deep designs of empire does he lay<br>       O’er them, whose cause he seems to take in hand;<br>     And prudently would make them lords at sea,<br>       To whom with ease he can give laws by land.</p>
<p>  10<br>   This saw our King; and long within his breast<br>       His pensive counsels balanced to and fro:<br>     He grieved the land he freed should be oppress’d,<br>       And he less for it than usurpers do.</p>
<p>  11<br>   His generous mind the fair ideas drew<br>       Of fame and honour, which in dangers lay;<br>     Where wealth, like fruit on precipices, grew,<br>       Not to be gather’d but by birds of prey.</p>
<p>  12<br>   The loss and gain each fatally were great;<br>       And still his subjects call’d aloud for war;<br>     But peaceful kings, o’er martial people set,<br>       Each, other’s poise and counterbalance are.</p>
<p>  13<br>   He first survey’d the charge with careful eyes,<br>       Which none but mighty monarchs could maintain;<br>     Yet judged, like vapours that from limbecks rise,<br>       It would in richer showers descend again.</p>
<p>  14<br>   At length resolved to assert the watery ball,<br>       He in himself did whole Armadoes bring:<br>     Him aged seamen might their master call,<br>       And choose for general, were he not their king.</p>
<p>  15<br>   It seems as every ship their sovereign knows,<br>       His awful summons they so soon obey;<br>     So hear the scaly herd when Proteus blows,<br>       And so to pasture follow through the sea.</p>
<p>  16<br>   To see this fleet upon the ocean move,<br>       Angels drew wide the curtains of the skies;<br>     And heaven, as if there wanted lights above,<br>       For tapers made two glaring comets rise.</p>
<p>  17<br>   Whether they unctuous exhalations are,<br>       Fired by the sun, or seeming so alone:<br>     Or each some more remote and slippery star,<br>       Which loses footing when to mortals shown.</p>
<p>  18<br>   Or one, that bright companion of the sun,<br>       Whose glorious aspect seal’d our new-born king;<br>     And now a round of greater years begun,<br>       New influence from his walks of light did bring.</p>
<p>  19<br>   Victorious York did first with famed success,<br>       To his known valour make the Dutch give place:<br>     Thus Heaven our monarch’s fortune did confess,<br>       Beginning conquest from his royal race.</p>
<p>  20<br>   But since it was decreed, auspicious King,<br>       In Britain’s right that thou shouldst wed the main,<br>     Heaven, as a gage, would cast some precious thing,<br>       And therefore doom’d that Lawson should be slain.</p>
<p>  21<br>   Lawson amongst the foremost met his fate,<br>       Whom sea-green Sirens from the rocks lament;<br>     Thus as an offering for the Grecian state,<br>       He first was kill’d who first to battle went.</p>
<p>  22<br>   Their chief blown up in air, not waves, expired,<br>       To which his pride presumed to give the law:<br>     The Dutch confess’d Heaven present, and retired,<br>       And all was Britain the wide ocean saw.</p>
<p>  23<br>   To nearest ports their shatter’d ships repair,<br>       Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed:<br>     So reverently men quit the open air,<br>       When thunder speaks the angry gods abroad.</p>
<p>  24<br>   And now approach’d their fleet from India, fraught<br>       With all the riches of the rising sun:<br>     And precious sand from southern climates brought,<br>       The fatal regions where the war begun.</p>
<p>  25<br>   Like hunted castors, conscious of their store,<br>       Their waylaid wealth to Norway’s coasts they bring:<br>     There first the north’s cold bosom spices bore,<br>       And winter brooded on the eastern spring.</p>
<p>  26<br>   By the rich scent we found our perfumed prey,<br>       Which, flank’d with rocks, did close in covert lie;<br>     And round about their murdering cannon lay,<br>       At once to threaten and invite the eye.</p>
<p>  27<br>   Fiercer than cannon, and than rocks more hard,<br>       The English undertake the unequal war:<br>     Seven ships alone, by which the port is barr’d,<br>       Besiege the Indies, and all Denmark dare.</p>
<p>  28<br>   These fight like husbands, but like lovers those:<br>       These fain would keep, and those more fain enjoy:<br>     And to such height their frantic passion grows,<br>       That what both love, both hazard to destroy.</p>
<p>  29<br>   Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball,<br>       And now their odours arm’d against them fly:<br>     Some preciously by shatter’d porcelain fall,<br>       And some by aromatic splinters die.</p>
<p>  30<br>   And though by tempests of the prize bereft,<br>       In Heaven’s inclemency some ease we find:<br>     Our foes we vanquish’d by our valour left,<br>       And only yielded to the seas and wind.</p>
<p>  31<br>   Nor wholly lost we so deserved a prey;<br>       For storms repenting part of it restored:<br>     Which, as a tribute from the Baltic sea,<br>       The British ocean sent her mighty lord.</p>
<p>  32<br>   Go, mortals, now; and vex yourselves in vain<br>       For wealth, which so uncertainly must come:<br>     When what was brought so far, and with such pain,<br>       Was only kept to lose it nearer home.</p>
<p>  33<br>   The son, who twice three months on th’ ocean tost,<br>       Prepared to tell what he had pass’d before,<br>     Now sees in English ships the Holland coast,<br>       And parents’ arms in vain stretch’d from the shore.</p>
<p>  34<br>   This careful husband had been long away,<br>       Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn;<br>     Who on their fingers learn’d to tell the day<br>       On which their father promised to return.</p>
<p>  35<br>   Such are the proud designs of human kind,<br>       And so we suffer shipwreck every where!<br>     Alas, what port can such a pilot find,<br>       Who in the night of fate must blindly steer!</p>
<p>  36<br>   The undistinguish’d seeds of good and ill,<br>       Heaven, in his bosom, from our knowledge hides:<br>     And draws them in contempt of human skill,<br>       Which oft for friends mistaken foes provides.</p>
<p>  37<br>   Let Munster’s prelate ever be accurst,<br>       In whom we seek the German faith in vain:<br>     Alas, that he should teach the English first,<br>       That fraud and avarice in the Church could reign!</p>
<p>  38<br>   Happy, who never trust a stranger’s will,<br>       Whose friendship’s in his interest understood!<br>     Since money given but tempts him to be ill,<br>       When power is too remote to make him good.</p>
<p>  39<br>   Till now, alone the mighty nations strove;<br>       The rest, at gaze, without the lists did stand:<br>     And threatening France, placed like a painted Jove,<br>       Kept idle thunder in his lifted hand.</p>
<p>  40<br>   That eunuch guardian of rich Holland’s trade,<br>       Who envies us what he wants power to enjoy;<br>     Whose noiseful valour does no foe invade,<br>       And weak assistance will his friends destroy.</p>
<p>  41<br>   Offended that we fought without his leave,<br>       He takes this time his secret hate to show:<br>     Which Charles does with a mind so calm receive,<br>       As one that neither seeks nor shuns his foe.</p>
<p>  42<br>   With France, to aid the Dutch, the Danes unite:<br>       France as their tyrant, Denmark as their slave,<br>     But when with one three nations join to fight,<br>       They silently confess that one more brave.</p>
<p>  43<br>   Lewis had chased the English from his shore;<br>       But Charles the French as subjects does invite:<br>     Would Heaven for each some Solomon restore,<br>       Who, by their mercy, may decide their right!</p>
<p>  44<br>   Were subjects so but only by their choice,<br>       And not from birth did forced dominion take,<br>     Our prince alone would have the public voice;<br>       And all his neighbours’ realms would deserts make.</p>
<p>  45<br>   He without fear a dangerous war pursues,<br>       Which without rashness he began before:<br>     As honour made him first the danger choose,<br>       So still he makes it good on virtue’s score.</p>
<p>  46<br>   The doubled charge his subjects’ love supplies,<br>       Who, in that bounty, to themselves are kind:<br>     So glad Egyptians see their Nilus rise,<br>       And in his plenty their abundance find.</p>
<p>  47<br>   With equal power he does two chiefs create,<br>       Two such as each seem’d worthiest when alone;<br>     Each able to sustain a nation’s fate,<br>       Since both had found a greater in their own.</p>
<p>  48<br>   Both great in courage, conduct, and in fame,<br>       Yet neither envious of the other’s praise;<br>     Their duty, faith, and interest too the same,<br>       Like mighty partners equally they raise.</p>
<p>  49<br>   The prince long time had courted fortune’s love,<br>       But once possess’d, did absolutely reign:<br>     Thus with their Amazons the heroes strove,<br>       And conquer’d first those beauties they would gain.</p>
<p>  50<br>   The Duke beheld, like Scipio, with disdain,<br>       That Carthage, which he ruin’d, rise once more;<br>     And shook aloft the fasces of the main,<br>       To fright those slaves with what they felt before.</p>
<p>  51<br>   Together to the watery camp they haste,<br>       Whom matrons passing to their children show:<br>     Infants’ first vows for them to heaven are cast,<br>       And future people bless them as they go.</p>
<p>  52<br>   With them no riotous pomp, nor Asian train,<br>       To infect a navy with their gaudy fears;<br>     To make slow fights, and victories but vain:<br>       But war severely like itself appears.</p>
<p>  53<br>   Diffusive of themselves, where’er they pass,<br>       They make that warmth in others they expect;<br>     Their valour works like bodies on a glass,<br>       And does its image on their men project.</p>
<p>  54<br>   Our fleet divides, and straight the Dutch appear,<br>       In number, and a famed commander, bold:<br>     The narrow seas can scarce their navy bear,<br>       Or crowded vessels can their soldiers hold.</p>
<p>  55<br>   The Duke, less numerous, but in courage more,<br>       On wings of all the winds to combat flies:<br>     His murdering guns a loud defiance roar,<br>       And bloody crosses on his flag-staffs rise.</p>
<p>  56<br>   Both furl their sails, and strip them for the fight;<br>       Their folded sheets dismiss the useless air:<br>     The Elean plains could boast no nobler sight,<br>       When struggling champions did their bodies bare.</p>
<p>  57<br>   Borne each by other in a distant line,<br>       The sea-built forts in dreadful order move:<br>     So vast the noise, as if not fleets did join,<br>       But lands unfix’d, and floating nations strove.</p>
<p>  58<br>   Now pass’d, on either side they nimbly tack;<br>       Both strive to intercept and guide the wind:<br>     And, in its eye, more closely they come back,<br>       To finish all the deaths they left behind.</p>
<p>  59<br>   On high-raised decks the haughty Belgians ride,<br>       Beneath whose shade our humble frigates go:<br>     Such port the elephant bears, and so defied<br>       By the rhinoceros, her unequal foe.</p>
<p>  60<br>   And as the build, so different is the fight;<br>       Their mounting shot is on our sails design’d:<br>     Deep in their hulls our deadly bullets light,<br>       And through the yielding planks a passage find.</p>
<p>  61<br>   Our dreaded admiral from far they threat,<br>       Whose batter’d rigging their whole war receives:<br>     All bare, like some old oak which tempests beat,<br>       He stands, and sees below his scatter’d leaves.</p>
<p>  62<br>   Heroes of old, when wounded, shelter sought;<br>       But he who meets all danger with disdain,<br>     Even in their face his ship to anchor brought,<br>       And steeple-high stood propt upon the main.</p>
<p>  63<br>   At this excess of courage, all amazed,<br>       The foremost of his foes awhile withdraw:<br>     With such respect in enter’d Rome they gazed,<br>       Who on high chairs the god-like fathers saw.</p>
<p>  64<br>   And now, as where Patroclus’ body lay,<br>       Here Trojan chiefs advanced, and there the Greek<br>     Ours o’er the Duke their pious wings display,<br>       And theirs the noblest spoils of Britain seek.</p>
<p>  65<br>   Meantime his busy mariners he hastes,<br>       His shatter’d sails with rigging to restore;<br>     And willing pines ascend his broken masts,<br>       Whose lofty heads rise higher than before.</p>
<p>  66<br>   Straight to the Dutch he turns his dreadful prow,<br>       More fierce the important quarrel to decide:<br>     Like swans, in long array his vessels show,<br>       Whose crests advancing do the waves divide.</p>
<p>  67<br>   They charge, recharge, and all along the sea<br>       They drive, and squander the huge Belgian fleet;<br>     Berkeley[41] alone, who nearest danger lay,<br>       Did a like fate with lost Creusa meet.</p>
<p>  68<br>   The night comes on, we eager to pursue<br>       The combat still, and they ashamed to leave:<br>     Till the last streaks of dying day withdrew,<br>       And doubtful moonlight did our rage deceive.</p>
<p>  69<br>   In the English fleet each ship resounds with joy,<br>       And loud applause of their great leader’s fame:<br>     In fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy,<br>       And, slumbering, smile at the imagined flame.</p>
<p>  70<br>   Not so the Holland fleet, who, tired and done,<br>       Stretch’d on their decks like weary oxen lie;<br>     Faint sweats all down their mighty members run;<br>       Vast bulks which little souls but ill supply.</p>
<p>  71<br>   In dreams they fearful precipices tread:<br>       Or, shipwreck’d, labour to some distant shore:<br>     Or in dark churches walk among the dead;<br>       They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more.</p>
<p>  72<br>   The morn they look on with unwilling eyes,<br>       Till from their main-top joyful news they hear<br>     Of ships, which by their mould bring new supplies,<br>       And in their colours Belgian lions bear.</p>
<p>  73<br>   Our watchful general had discern’d from far<br>       This mighty succour, which made glad the foe:<br>     He sigh’d, but, like a father of the war,<br>       His face spake hope, while deep his sorrows flow.</p>
<p>  74<br>   His wounded men he first sends off to shore,<br>       Never till now unwilling to obey:<br>     They, not their wounds, but want of strength deplore,<br>       And think them happy who with him can stay.</p>
<p>  75<br>   Then to the rest, Rejoice, said he, to-day;<br>       In you the fortune of Great Britain lies:<br>     Among so brave a people, you are they<br>       Whom Heaven has chose to fight for such a prize.</p>
<p>  76<br>   If number English courages could quell,<br>       We should at first have shunn’d, not met, our foes,<br>     Whose numerous sails the fearful only tell:<br>       Courage from hearts and not from numbers grows.</p>
<p>  77<br>   He said, nor needed more to say: with haste<br>       To their known stations cheerfully they go;<br>     And all at once, disdaining to be last,<br>       Solicit every gale to meet the foe.</p>
<p>  78<br>   Nor did the encouraged Belgians long delay,<br>       But bold in others, not themselves, they stood:<br>     So thick, our navy scarce could steer their way,<br>       But seem’d to wander in a moving wood.</p>
<p>  79<br>   Our little fleet was now engaged so far,<br>       That, like the sword-fish in the whale, they fought:<br>     The combat only seem’d a civil war,<br>       Till through their bowels we our passage wrought.</p>
<p>  80<br>   Never had valour, no not ours, before<br>       Done aught like this upon the land or main,<br>     Where not to be o’ercome was to do more<br>       Than all the conquests former kings did gain.</p>
<p>  81<br>   The mighty ghosts of our great Harries rose,<br>       And armed Edwards look’d with anxious eyes,<br>     To see this fleet among unequal foes,<br>       By which fate promised them their Charles should rise.</p>
<p>  82<br>   Meantime the Belgians tack upon our rear,<br>       And raking chase-guns through our sterns they send:<br>     Close by their fire ships, like jackals appear<br>       Who on their lions for the prey attend.</p>
<p>  83<br>   Silent in smoke of cannon they come on:<br>       Such vapours once did fiery Cacus hide:<br>     In these the height of pleased revenge is shown,<br>       Who burn contented by another’s side.</p>
<p>  84<br>   Sometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet,<br>       Deceived themselves, or to preserve some friend,<br>     Two grappling Ætnas on the ocean meet,<br>       And English fires with Belgian flames contend.</p>
<p>  85<br>   Now at each tack our little fleet grows less;<br>       And like maim’d fowl, swim lagging on the main:<br>     Their greater loss their numbers scarce confess,<br>       While they lose cheaper than the English gain.</p>
<p>  86<br>   Have you not seen, when, whistled from the fist,<br>       Some falcon stoops at what her eye design’d,<br>     And, with her eagerness the quarry miss’d,<br>       Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind.</p>
<p>  87<br>   The dastard crow that to the wood made wing,<br>       And sees the groves no shelter can afford,<br>     With her loud caws her craven kind does bring,<br>       Who, safe in numbers, cuff the noble bird.</p>
<p>  88<br>   Among the Dutch thus Albemarle did fare:<br>       He could not conquer, and disdain’d to fly;<br>     Past hope of safety, ‘twas his latest care,<br>       Like falling Cæsar, decently to die.</p>
<p>  89<br>   Yet pity did his manly spirit move,<br>       To see those perish who so well had fought;<br>     And generously with his despair he strove,<br>       Resolved to live till he their safety wrought.</p>
<p>  90<br>   Let other muses write his prosperous fate,<br>       Of conquer’d nations tell, and kings restored;<br>     But mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate,<br>       Which, like the sun’s, more wonders does afford.</p>
<p>  91<br>   He drew his mighty frigates all before,<br>       On which the foe his fruitless force employs:<br>     His weak ones deep into his rear he bore<br>       Remote from guns, as sick men from the noise.</p>
<p>  92<br>   His fiery cannon did their passage guide,<br>       And following smoke obscured them from the foe:<br>     Thus Israel safe from the Egyptian’s pride,<br>       By flaming pillars, and by clouds did go.</p>
<p>  93<br>   Elsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat,<br>       But here our courages did theirs subdue:<br>     So Xenophon once led that famed retreat,<br>       Which first the Asian empire overthrew.</p>
<p>  94<br>   The foe approach’d; and one for his bold sin<br>       Was sunk; as he that touch’d the ark was slain:<br>     The wild waves master’d him and suck’d him in,<br>       And smiling eddies dimpled on the main.</p>
<p>  95<br>   This seen, the rest at awful distance stood:<br>        As if they had been there as servants set<br>     To stay, or to go on, as he thought good,<br>        And not pursue, but wait on his retreat.</p>
<p>  96<br>   So Lybian huntsmen, on some sandy plain,<br>       From shady coverts roused, the lion chase:<br>     The kingly beast roars out with loud disdain,<br>       And slowly moves, unknowing to give place.</p>
<p>  97<br>   But if some one approach to dare his force,<br>       He swings his tail, and swiftly turns him round;<br>     With one paw seizes on his trembling horse,<br>       And with the other tears him to the ground.</p>
<p>  98<br>   Amidst these toils succeeds the balmy night;<br>       Now hissing waters the quench’d guns restore;<br>     And weary waves, withdrawing from the fight,<br>       Lie lull’d and panting on the silent shore:</p>
<p>  99<br>   The moon shone clear on the becalmed flood,<br>       Where, while her beams like glittering silver play,<br>     Upon the deck our careful general stood,<br>       And deeply mused on the succeeding day.</p>
<p> 100<br>  That happy sun, said he, will rise again,<br>       Who twice victorious did our navy see:<br>     And I alone must view him rise in vain,<br>       Without one ray of all his star for me.</p>
<p> 101<br>  Yet like an English general will I die,<br>       And all the ocean make my spacious grave:<br>     Women and cowards on the land may lie;<br>       The sea’s a tomb that’s proper for the brave.</p>
<p> 102<br>  Restless he pass’d the remnant of the night,<br>       Till the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh:<br>     And burning ships, the martyrs of the fight,<br>       With paler fires beheld the eastern sky.</p>
<p> 103<br>  But now, his stores of ammunition spent,<br>       His naked valour is his only guard;<br>     Rare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent,<br>       And solitary guns are scarcely heard.</p>
<p> 104<br>  Thus far had fortune power, here forced to stay,<br>       Nor longer durst with virtue be at strife:<br>     This as a ransom Albemarle did pay,<br>       For all the glories of so great a life.</p>
<p> 105<br>  For now brave Rupert from afar appears,<br>       Whose waving streamers the glad general knows:<br>     With full spread sails his eager navy steers,<br>       And every ship in swift proportion grows.</p>
<p> 106<br>  The anxious prince had heard the cannon long,<br>       And from that length of time dire omens drew<br>     Of English overmatch’d, and Dutch too strong,<br>       Who never fought three days, but to pursue.</p>
<p> 107<br>  Then, as an eagle, who, with pious care<br>       Was beating widely on the wing for prey,<br>     To her now silent eyrie does repair,<br>       And finds her callow infants forced away:</p>
<p> 108<br>  Stung with her love, she stoops upon the plain,<br>       The broken air loud whistling as she flies:<br>     She stops and listens, and shoots forth again,<br>       And guides her pinions by her young ones’ cries.</p>
<p> 109<br>  With such kind passion hastes the prince to fight,<br>       And spreads his flying canvas to the sound;<br>     Him, whom no danger, were he there, could fright,<br>       Now absent every little noise can wound.</p>
<p> 110<br>  As in a drought the thirsty creatures cry,<br>       And gape upon the gather’d clouds for rain,<br>     And first the martlet meets it in the sky,<br>       And with wet wings joys all the feather’d train.</p>
<p> 111<br>  With such glad hearts did our despairing men<br>       Salute the appearance of the prince’s fleet;<br>     And each ambitiously would claim the ken,<br>       That with first eyes did distant safety meet.</p>
<p> 112<br>  The Dutch, who came like greedy hinds before,<br>       To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield,<br>     Now look like those, when rolling thunders roar,<br>       And sheets of lightning blast the standing field.</p>
<p> 113<br>  Full in the prince’s passage, hills of sand,<br>       And dangerous flats in secret ambush lay;<br>     Where the false tides skim o’er the cover’d land,<br>       And seamen with dissembled depths betray.</p>
<p> 114<br>  The wily Dutch, who, like fallen angels, fear’d<br>       This new Messiah’s coming, there did wait,<br>     And round the verge their braving vessels steer’d,<br>       To tempt his courage with so fair a bait.</p>
<p> 115<br>  But he, unmoved, contemns their idle threat,<br>       Secure of fame whene’er he please to fight:<br>     His cold experience tempers all his heat,<br>       And inbred worth doth boasting valour slight.</p>
<p> 116<br>  Heroic virtue did his actions guide,<br>       And he the substance, not the appearance chose<br>     To rescue one such friend he took more pride,<br>       Than to destroy whole thousands of such foes.</p>
<p> 117<br>  But when approach’d, in strict embraces bound,<br>       Rupert and Albemarle together grow;<br>     He joys to have his friend in safety found,<br>       Which he to none but to that friend would owe.</p>
<p> 118<br>  The cheerful soldiers, with new stores supplied,<br>       Now long to execute their spleenful will;<br>     And, in revenge for those three days they tried,<br>       Wish one, like Joshua’s, when the sun stood still.</p>
<p> 119<br>  Thus reinforced, against the adverse fleet,<br>       Still doubling ours, brave Rupert leads the way:<br>     With the first blushes of the morn they meet,<br>       And bring night back upon the new-born day.</p>
<p> 120<br>  His presence soon blows up the kindling fight,<br>       And his loud guns speak thick like angry men:<br>     It seem’d as slaughter had been breathed all night,<br>       And Death new pointed his dull dart again.</p>
<p> 121<br>  The Dutch too well his mighty conduct knew,<br>       And matchless courage since the former fight;<br>     Whose navy like a stiff-stretch’d cord did show,<br>       Till he bore in and bent them into flight.</p>
<p> 122<br>  The wind he shares, while half their fleet offends<br>       His open side, and high above him shows:<br>     Upon the rest at pleasure he descends,<br>       And doubly harm’d he double harms bestows.</p>
<p> 123<br>  Behind the general mends his weary pace,<br>       And sullenly to his revenge he sails:<br>     So glides some trodden serpent on the grass,<br>       And long behind his wounded volume trails.</p>
<p> 124<br>  The increasing sound is borne to either shore,<br>       And for their stakes the throwing nations fear:<br>     Their passions double with the cannons’ roar,<br>       And with warm wishes each man combats there.</p>
<p> 125<br>  Plied thick and close as when the fight begun,<br>       Their huge unwieldy navy wastes away;<br>     So sicken waning moons too near the sun,<br>       And blunt their crescents on the edge of day.</p>
<p> 126<br>  And now reduced on equal terms to fight,<br>       Their ships like wasted patrimonies show;<br>     Where the thin scattering trees admit the light,<br>       And shun each other’s shadows as they grow.</p>
<p> 127<br>  The warlike prince had sever’d from the rest<br>       Two giant ships, the pride of all the main;<br>     Which with his one so vigorously he prest,<br>       And flew so home they could not rise again.</p>
<p> 128<br>  Already batter’d, by his lee they lay,<br>       In rain upon the passing winds they call:<br>     The passing winds through their torn canvas play,<br>       And flagging sails on heartless sailors fall.</p>
<p> 129<br>  Their open’d sides receive a gloomy light,<br>       Dreadful as day let into shades below:<br>     Without, grim Death rides barefaced in their sight,<br>       And urges entering billows as they flow.</p>
<p> 130<br>  When one dire shot, the last they could supply,<br>       Close by the board the prince’s mainmast bore:<br>     All three now helpless by each other lie,<br>       And this offends not, and those fear no more.</p>
<p> 131<br>  So have I seen some fearful hare maintain<br>       A course, till tired before the dog she lay:<br>     Who, stretch’d behind her, pants upon the plain,<br>       Past power to kill, as she to get away.</p>
<p> 132<br>  With his loll’d tongue he faintly licks his prey;<br>       His warm breath blows her flix[44] up as she lies;<br>     She trembling creeps upon the ground away,<br>       And looks back to him with beseeching eyes.</p>
<p> 133<br>  The prince unjustly does his stars accuse,<br>       Which hinder’d him to push his fortune on;<br>     For what they to his courage did refuse,<br>       By mortal valour never must be done.</p>
<p> 134<br>  This lucky hour the wise Batavian takes,<br>       And warns his tatter’d fleet to follow home;<br>     Proud to have so got off with equal stakes,<br>       Where ‘twas a triumph not to be o’ercome.</p>
<p> 135<br>  The general’s force, as kept alive by fight,<br>       Now not opposed, no longer can pursue:<br>     Lasting till heaven had done his courage right;<br>       When he had conquer’d he his weakness knew.</p>
<p> 136<br>  He casts a frown on the departing foe,<br>       And sighs to see him quit the watery field:<br>     His stern fix’d eyes no satisfaction show,<br>       For all the glories which the fight did yield.</p>
<p> 137<br>  Though, as when fiends did miracles avow,<br>       He stands confess’d e’en by the boastful Dutch:<br>     He only does his conquest disavow,<br>       And thinks too little what they found too much.</p>
<p> 138<br>  Return’d, he with the fleet resolved to stay;<br>       No tender thoughts of home his heart divide;<br>     Domestic joys and cares he puts away;<br>       For realms are households which the great must guide.</p>
<p> 139<br>  As those who unripe veins in mines explore,<br>       On the rich bed again the warm turf lay,<br>     Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,<br>       And know it will be gold another day:</p>
<p> 140<br>  So looks our monarch on this early fight,<br>       Th’ essay and rudiments of great success;<br>     Which all-maturing time must bring to light,<br>       While he, like Heaven, does each day’s labour bless.</p>
<p> 141<br>  Heaven ended not the first or second day,<br>       Yet each was perfect to the work design’d;<br>     God and king’s work, when they their work survey,<br>       A passive aptness in all subjects find.</p>
<p> 142<br>  In burden’d vessels first, with speedy care,<br>       His plenteous stores do seasoned timber send;<br>     Thither the brawny carpenters repair,<br>       And as the surgeons of maim’d ships attend.</p>
<p> 143<br>  With cord and canvas from rich Hamburgh sent,<br>       His navy’s molted wings he imps once more:<br>     Tall Norway fir, their masts in battle spent,<br>       And English oak, sprung leaks and planks restore.</p>
<p> 144<br>  All hands employ’d, the royal work grows warm:<br>       Like labouring bees on a long summer’s day,<br>     Some sound the trumpet for the rest to swarm.<br>       And some on bells of tasted lilies play.</p>
<p> 145<br>  With gluey wax some new foundations lay<br>       Of virgin-combs, which from the roof are hung:<br>     Some arm’d, within doors upon duty stay,<br>       Or tend the sick, or educate the young.</p>
<p> 146<br>  So here some pick out bullets from the sides,<br>       Some drive old oakum through each seam and rift:<br>     Their left hand does the calking-iron guide,<br>       The rattling mallet with the right they lift.</p>
<p> 147<br>  With boiling pitch another near at hand,<br>       From friendly Sweden brought, the seams instops:<br>     Which well paid o’er, the salt sea waves withstand,<br>       And shakes them from the rising beak in drops.</p>
<p> 148<br>  Some the gall’d ropes with dauby marline bind,<br>       Or sear-cloth masts with strong tarpaulin coats:<br>     To try new shrouds one mounts into the wind,<br>       And one below their ease or stiffness notes.</p>
<p> 149<br>  Our careful monarch stands in person by,<br>       His new-cast cannons’ firmness to explore:<br>     The strength of big-corn’d powder loves to try,<br>       And ball and cartridge sorts for every bore.</p>
<p> 150<br>  Each day brings fresh supplies of arms and men,<br>       And ships which all last winter were abroad;<br>     And such as fitted since the fight had been,<br>       Or, new from stocks, were fallen into the road.</p>
<p> 151<br>  The goodly London in her gallant trim<br>       (The Phoenix daughter of the vanish’d old).<br>     Like a rich bride does to the ocean swim,<br>       And on her shadow rides in floating gold.</p>
<p> 152<br>  Her flag aloft spread ruffling to the wind,<br>       And sanguine streamers seem the flood to fire;<br>     The weaver, charm’d with what his loom design’d,<br>       Goes on to sea, and knows not to retire.</p>
<p> 153<br>  With roomy decks, her guns of mighty strength,<br>       Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves;<br>     Deep in her draught, and warlike in her length,<br>       She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves.</p>
<p> 154<br>  This martial present, piously design’d,<br>       The loyal city give their best-loved King:<br>     And with a bounty ample as the wind,<br>       Built, fitted, and maintain’d, to aid him bring.</p>
<p> 155<br>  By viewing Nature, Nature’s handmaid, Art,<br>       Makes mighty things from small beginnings grow:<br>     Thus fishes first to shipping did impart,<br>       Their tail the rudder, and their head the prow.</p>
<p> 156<br>  Some log perhaps upon the waters swam,<br>       An useless drift, which, rudely cut within,<br>     And, hollow’d, first a floating trough became,<br>       And cross some rivulet passage did begin.</p>
<p> 157<br>  In shipping such as this, the Irish kern,<br>       And untaught Indian, on the stream did glide:<br>     Ere sharp-keel’d boats to stem the flood did learn,<br>       Or fin-like oars did spread from either side.</p>
<p> 158<br>  Add but a sail, and Saturn so appear’d,<br>       When from lost empire he to exile went,<br>     And with the golden age to Tiber steer’d,<br>       Where coin and commerce first he did invent.</p>
<p> 159<br>  Rude as their ships was navigation then;<br>       No useful compass or meridian known;<br>     Coasting, they kept the land within their ken,<br>       And knew no North but when the Pole-star shone.</p>
<p> 160<br>  Of all who since have used the open sea,<br>       Than the bold English none more fame have won:<br>     Beyond the year, and out of heaven’s high way,<br>       They make discoveries where they see no sun.</p>
<p> 161<br>  But what so long in vain, and yet unknown,<br>       By poor mankind’s benighted wit is sought,<br>     Shall in this age to Britain first be shown,<br>       And hence be to admiring nations taught.</p>
<p> 162<br>  The ebbs of tides and their mysterious flow,<br>       We, as art’s elements, shall understand,<br>     And as by line upon the ocean go,<br>       Whose paths shall be familiar as the land.</p>
<p> 163<br>  Instructed ships shall sail to quick commerce,<br>       By which remotest regions are allied;<br>     Which makes one city of the universe,<br>       Where some may gain, and all may be supplied.</p>
<p> 164<br>  Then we upon our globe’s last verge shall go,<br>       And view the ocean leaning on the sky:<br>     From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,<br>       And on the lunar world securely pry.</p>
<p> 165<br>  This I foretell from your auspicious care,<br>       Who great in search of God and nature grow;<br>    Who best your wise Creator’s praise declare,<br>       Since best to praise his works is best to know.</p>
<p> 166<br>  O truly royal! who behold the law<br>       And rule of beings in your Maker’s mind:<br>     And thence, like limbecks, rich ideas draw,<br>       To fit the levell’d use of human-kind.</p>
<p> 197<br>  But first the toils of war we must endure,<br>       And from the injurious Dutch redeem the seas.<br>     War makes the valiant of his right secure,<br>       And gives up fraud to be chastised with ease.</p>
<p> 168<br>  Already were the Belgians on our coast,<br>       Whose fleet more mighty every day became<br>     By late success, which they did falsely boast,<br>       And now by first appearing seem’d to claim.</p>
<p> 169<br>  Designing, subtle, diligent, and close,<br>       They knew to manage war with wise delay:<br>     Yet all those arts their vanity did cross,<br>       And by their pride their prudence did betray.</p>
<p> 170<br>  Nor stay’d the English long; but, well supplied,<br>       Appear as numerous as the insulting foe:<br>     The combat now by courage must be tried,<br>       And the success the braver nation show.</p>
<p> 171<br>  There was the Plymouth squadron now come in,<br>       Which in the Straits last winter was abroad;<br>     Which twice on Biscay’s working bay had been,<br>       And on the midland sea the French had awed.</p>
<p> 172<br>  Old expert Allen, loyal all along,<br>       Famed for his action on the Smyrna fleet:<br>     And Holmes, whose name shall live in epic song,<br>       While music numbers, or while verse has feet.</p>
<p> 173<br>  Holmes, the Achates of the general’s fight;<br>       Who first bewitch’d our eyes with Guinea gold;<br>     As once old Cato in the Roman sight<br>       The tempting fruits of Afric did unfold.</p>
<p> 174<br>  With him went Spragge, as bountiful as brave,<br>       Whom his high courage to command had brought:<br>     Harman, who did the twice-fired Harry save,<br>       And in his burning ship undaunted fought.</p>
<p> 175<br>  Young Hollis, on a Muse by Mars begot,<br>       Born, Cæsar-like, to write and act great deeds:<br>     Impatient to revenge his fatal shot,<br>       His right hand doubly to his left succeeds.</p>
<p> 176<br>  Thousands were there in darker fame that dwell,<br>       Whose deeds some nobler poem shall adorn:<br>     And, though to me unknown, they sure fought well<br>       Whom Rupert led, and who were British born.</p>
<p> 177<br>  Of every size an hundred fighting sail:<br>       So vast the navy now at anchor rides,<br>     That underneath it the press’d waters fail,<br>       And with its weight it shoulders off the tides.</p>
<p> 178<br>  Now anchors weigh’d, the seamen shout so shrill,<br>       That heaven and earth and the wide ocean rings:<br>     A breeze from westward waits their sails to fill,<br>       And rests in those high beds his downy wings.</p>
<p> 179<br>  The wary Dutch this gathering storm foresaw,<br>       And durst not bide it on the English coast:<br>     Behind their treacherous shallows they withdraw,<br>       And there lay snares to catch the British host.</p>
<p> 180<br>  So the false spider, when her nets are spread,<br>       Deep ambush’d in her silent den does lie:<br>     And feels far off the trembling of her thread,<br>       Whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly.</p>
<p> 181<br>  Then if at last she find him fast beset,<br>       She issues forth and runs along her loom:<br>     She joys to touch the captive in her net,<br>       And drags the little wretch in triumph home.</p>
<p> 182<br>  The Belgians hoped, that, with disorder’d haste,<br>       Our deep-cut keels upon the sands might run:<br>     Or, if with caution leisurely were past,<br>       Their numerous gross might charge us one by one.</p>
<p> 183<br>  But with a fore-wind pushing them above,<br>       And swelling tide that heaved them from below,<br>     O’er the blind flats our warlike squadrons move,<br>       And with spread sails to welcome battle go.</p>
<p> 184<br>  It seem’d as there the British Neptune stood,<br>       With all his hosts of waters at command.<br>     Beneath them to submit the officious flood;<br>       And with his trident shoved them off the sand.</p>
<p> 185<br>  To the pale foes they suddenly draw near,<br>       And summon them to unexpected fight:<br>     They start like murderers when ghosts appear,<br>       And draw their curtains in the dead of night.</p>
<p> 186<br>  Now van to van the foremost squadrons meet,<br>       The midmost battles hastening up behind,<br>     Who view far off the storm of falling sleet,<br>       And hear their thunder rattling in the wind.</p>
<p> 187<br>  At length the adverse admirals appear;<br>       The two bold champions of each country’s right:<br>     Their eyes describe the lists as they come near,<br>       And draw the lines of death before they fight.</p>
<p> 188<br>  The distance judged for shot of every size,<br>       The linstocks touch, the ponderous ball expires:<br>    The vigorous seaman every port-hole plies,<br>       And adds his heart to every gun he fires!</p>
<p> 189<br>  Fierce was the fight on the proud Belgians’ side,<br>       For honour, which they seldom sought before!<br>     But now they by their own vain boasts were tied,<br>       And forced at least in show to prize it more.</p>
<p> 190<br>  But sharp remembrance on the English part,<br>       And shame of being match’d by such a foe,<br>     Rouse conscious virtue up in every heart,<br>       And seeming to be stronger makes them so.</p>
<p>191<br>  Nor long the Belgians could that fleet sustain,<br>       Which did two generals’ fates, and Cæsar’s bear:<br>     Each several ship a victory did gain,<br>       As Rupert or as Albemarle were there.</p>
<p> 192<br>  Their batter’d admiral too soon withdrew,<br>       Unthank’d by ours for his unfinish’d fight;<br>     But he the minds of his Dutch masters knew,<br>       Who call’d that Providence which we call’d flight.</p>
<p> 193<br>  Never did men more joyfully obey,<br>       Or sooner understood the sign to fly:<br>     With such alacrity they bore away,<br>       As if to praise them all the States stood by.</p>
<p> 194<br>  O famous leader of the Belgian fleet,<br>       Thy monument inscribed such praise shall wear,<br>     As Varro, timely flying, once did meet,<br>       Because he did not of his Rome despair.</p>
<p> 195<br>  Behold that navy, which a while before,<br>       Provoked the tardy English close to fight,<br>     Now draw their beaten vessels close to shore,<br>       As larks lie, dared, to shun the hobby’s flight.</p>
<p> 196<br>  Whoe’er would English monuments survey,<br>       In other records may our courage know:<br>     But let them hide the story of this day,<br>       Whose fame was blemish’d by too base a foe.</p>
<p> 197<br>  Or if too busily they will inquire<br>       Into a victory which we disdain;<br>     Then let them know the Belgians did retire<br>       Before the patron saint of injured Spain.</p>
<p> 198<br>  Repenting England this revengeful day<br>       To Philip’s manes did an offering bring:<br>     England, which first by leading them astray,<br>       Hatch’d up rebellion to destroy her King.</p>
<p> 199<br>  Our fathers bent their baneful industry,<br>       To check a, monarchy that slowly grew;<br>     But did not France or Holland’s fate foresee,<br>       Whose rising power to swift dominion flew.</p>
<p> 200<br>  In fortune’s empire blindly thus we go,<br>       And wander after pathless destiny;<br>     Whose dark resorts since prudence cannot know,<br>       In vain it would provide for what shall be.</p>
<p> 201<br>  But whate’er English to the bless’d shall go,<br>       And the fourth Harry or first Orange meet;<br>     Find him disowning of a Bourbon foe,<br>       And him detesting a Batavian fleet.</p>
<p> 202<br>  Now on their coasts our conquering navy rides,<br>       Waylays their merchants, and their land besets:<br>     Each day new wealth without their care provides;<br>       They lie asleep with prizes in their nets.</p>
<p> 203<br>  So, close behind some promontory lie<br>       The huge leviathans to attend their prey;<br>     And give no chase, but swallow in the fry,<br>       Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way.</p>
<p> 204<br>  Nor was this all: in ports and roads remote,<br>       Destructive fires among whole fleets we send:<br>     Triumphant flames upon the water float,<br>       And out-bound ships at home their voyage end.</p>
<p> 205<br>  Those various squadrons variously design’d,<br>       Each vessel freighted with a several load,<br>     Each squadron waiting for a several wind,<br>       All find but one, to burn them in the road.</p>
<p> 206<br>  Some bound for Guinea, golden sand to find,<br>       Bore all the gauds the simple natives wear;<br>     Some for the pride of Turkish courts design’d,<br>       For folded turbans finest Holland bear.</p>
<p> 207<br>  Some English wool, vex’d in a Belgian loom,<br>       And into cloth of spungy softness made,<br>     Did into France, or colder Denmark, doom,<br>       To ruin with worse ware our staple trade.</p>
<p> 208<br>  Our greedy seamen rummage every hold,<br>       Smile on the booty of each wealthier chest;<br>     And, as the priests who with their gods make bold,<br>       Take what they like, and sacrifice the rest.</p>
<p> 209<br>  But ah! how insincere are all our joys!<br>       Which, sent from heaven, like lightning make no stay;<br>     Their palling taste the journey’s length destroys,<br>       Or grief, sent post, o’ertakes them on the way.</p>
<p> 210<br>  Swell’d with our late successes on the foe,<br>       Which France and Holland wanted power to cross,<br>     We urge an unseen fate to lay us low,<br>       And feed their envious eyes with English loss.</p>
<p> 211<br>  Each element His dread command obeys,<br>       Who makes or ruins with a smile or frown;<br>     Who, as by one he did our nation raise,<br>       So now he with another pulls us down.</p>
<p> 212<br>  Yet London, empress of the northern clime,<br>       By an high fate thou greatly didst expire;<br>     Great as the world’s, which, at the death of time<br>       Must fall, and rise a nobler frame by fire!</p>
<p> 213<br>  As when some dire usurper Heaven provides,<br>       To scourge his country with a lawless sway;<br>     His birth perhaps some petty village hides,<br>       And sets his cradle out of fortune’s way.</p>
<p> 214<br>  Till fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out,<br>       And hurries him to mighty mischiefs on:<br>     His prince, surprised at first, no ill could doubt,<br>       And wants the power to meet it when ‘tis known.</p>
<p> 215<br>  Such was the rise of this prodigious fire,<br>       Which, in mean buildings first obscurely bred,<br>     From thence did soon to open streets aspire,<br>       And straight to palaces and temples spread.</p>
<p> 216<br>  The diligence of trades and noiseful gain,<br>       And luxury more late, asleep were laid:<br>     All was the night’s; and in her silent reign<br>       No sound the rest of nature did invade.</p>
<p> 217<br>  In this deep quiet, from what source unknown,<br>       Those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose;<br>     And first few scattering sparks about were blown,<br>       Big with the flames that to our ruin rose.</p>
<p> 218<br>  Then in some close-pent room it crept along,<br>       And, smouldering as it went, in silence fed;<br>     Till the infant monster, with devouring strong,<br>       Walk’d boldly upright with exalted head.</p>
<p> 219<br>  Now like some rich or mighty murderer,<br>       Too great for prison, which he breaks with gold;<br>     Who fresher for new mischiefs does appear,<br>       And dares the world to tax him with the old:</p>
<p> 220<br>  So ‘scapes the insulting fire his narrow jail,<br>       And makes small outlets into open air:<br>     There the fierce winds his tender force assail,<br>       And beat him downward to his first repair.</p>
<p> 221<br>  The winds, like crafty courtesans, withheld<br>       His flames from burning, but to blow them more:<br>     And every fresh attempt he is repell’d<br>       With faint denials weaker than before.</p>
<p> 222<br>  And now no longer letted of his prey,<br>       He leaps up at it with enraged desire:<br>     O’erlooks the neighbours with a wide survey,<br>       And nods at every house his threatening fire.</p>
<p> 223<br>  The ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend,<br>       With bold fanatic spectres to rejoice:<br>     About the fire into a dance they bend,<br>       And sing their sabbath notes with feeble voice.</p>
<p> 224<br>  Our guardian angel saw them where they sate<br>       Above the palace of our slumbering king:<br>     He sigh’d, abandoning his charge to fate,<br>       And, drooping, oft look’d back upon the wing.</p>
<p> 225<br>  At length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze<br>       Call’d up some waking lover to the sight;<br>     And long it was ere he the rest could raise,<br>       Whose heavy eyelids yet were full of night.</p>
<p> 226<br>  The next to danger, hot pursued by fate,<br>       Half-clothed, half-naked, hastily retire:<br>     And frighted mothers strike their breasts too late,<br>       For helpless infants left amidst the fire.</p>
<p> 227<br>  Their cries soon waken all the dwellers near;<br>       Now murmuring noises rise in every street:<br>     The more remote run stumbling with their fear,<br>       And in the dark men jostle as they meet.</p>
<p> 228<br>  So weary bees in little cells repose;<br>       But if night-robbers lift the well-stored hive,<br>     An humming through their waxen city grows,<br>       And out upon each other’s wings they drive.</p>
<p> 229<br>  Now streets grow throng’d and busy as by day:<br>       Some run for buckets to the hallow’d quire:<br>     Some cut the pipes, and some the engines play;<br>       And some more bold mount ladders to the fire.</p>
<p> 230<br>  In vain: for from the east a Belgian wind<br>       His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent;<br>     The flames impell’d soon left their foes behind,<br>       And forward with a wanton fury went.</p>
<p> 231<br>  A quay of fire ran all along the shore,<br>       And lighten’d all the river with a blaze:<br>     The waken’d tides began again to roar,<br>       And wondering fish in shining waters gaze.</p>
<p> 232<br>  Old father Thames raised up his reverend head,<br>       But fear’d the fate of Simois would return:<br>     Deep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed,<br>       And shrunk his waters back into his urn.</p>
<p> 233<br>  The fire, meantime, walks in a broader gross;<br>       To either hand his wings he opens wide:<br>     He wades the streets, and straight he reaches cross,<br>       And plays his longing flames on the other side.</p>
<p> 234<br>  At first they warm, then scorch, and then they take;<br>       Now with long necks from side to side they feed:<br>     At length, grown strong, their mother-fire forsake,<br>       And a new colony of flames succeed.</p>
<p> 235<br>  To every nobler portion of the town<br>       The curling billows roll their restless tide:<br>     In parties now they straggle up and down,<br>       As armies, unopposed, for prey divide.</p>
<p> 236<br>  One mighty squadron with a side-wind sped,<br>       Through narrow lanes his cumber’d fire does haste,<br>     By powerful charms of gold and silver led,<br>       The Lombard bankers and the ‘Change to waste.</p>
<p> 237<br>  Another backward to the Tower would go,<br>       And slowly eats his way against the wind:<br>     But the main body of the marching foe<br>       Against the imperial palace is design’d.</p>
<p> 238<br>  Now day appears, and with the day the King,<br>       Whose early care had robb’d him of his rest:<br>     Far off the cracks of falling houses ring,<br>       And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast.</p>
<p> 239<br>  Near as he draws, thick harbingers of smoke<br>       With gloomy pillars cover all the place;<br>     Whose little intervals of night are broke<br>       By sparks, that drive against his sacred face.</p>
<p> 240<br>  More than his guards, his sorrows made him known,<br>       And pious tears, which down his cheeks did shower;<br>     The wretched in his grief forgot their own;<br>       So much the pity of a king has power.</p>
<p> 241<br>  He wept the flames of what he loved so well,<br>       And what so well had merited his love:<br>     For never prince in grace did more excel,<br>       Or royal city more in duty strove.</p>
<p> 242<br>  Nor with an idle care did he behold:<br>       Subjects may grieve, but monarchs must redress;<br>     He cheers the fearful, and commends the bold,<br>       And makes despairers hope for good success.</p>
<p> 243<br>  Himself directs what first is to be done,<br>       And orders all the succours which they bring,<br>     The helpful and the good about him run,<br>       And form an army worthy such a king.</p>
<p> 244<br>  He sees the dire contagion spread so fast,<br>       That, where it seizes, all relief is vain:<br>     And therefore must unwillingly lay waste<br>       That country, which would else the foe maintain.</p>
<p> 245<br>  The powder blows up all before the fire:<br>       The amazèd flames stand gather’d on a heap;<br>     And from the precipice’s brink retire,<br>       Afraid to venture on so large a leap.</p>
<p> 246<br>  Thus fighting fires a while themselves consume,<br>       But straight, like Turks forced on to win or die,<br>     They first lay tender bridges of their fume,<br>       And o’er the breach in unctuous vapours fly.</p>
<p> 247<br>  Part stay for passage, till a gust of wind<br>       Ships o’er their forces in a shining sheet:<br>     Part creeping under ground their journey blind,<br>       And climbing from below their fellows meet.</p>
<p> 248<br>  Thus to some desert plain, or old woodside,<br>       Dire night-hags come from far to dance their round;<br>     And o’er broad rivers on their fiends they ride,<br>       Or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground.</p>
<p> 249<br>  No help avails: for hydra-like, the fire<br>       Lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way;<br>     And scarce the wealthy can one half retire,<br>       Before he rushes in to share the prey.</p>
<p> 250<br>  The rich grow suppliant, and the poor grow proud;<br>       Those offer mighty gain, and these ask more:<br>     So void of pity is the ignoble crowd,<br>       When others’ ruin may increase their store.</p>
<p> 251<br>  As those who live by shores with joy behold<br>       Some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh;<br>     And from the rocks leap down for shipwreck’d gold,<br>       And seek the tempests which the others fly:</p>
<p> 252<br>  So these but wait the owners’ last despair,<br>       And what’s permitted to the flames invade;<br>     Even from their jaws they hungry morsels tear,<br>       And on their backs the spoils of Vulcan lade.</p>
<p> 253<br>  The days were all in this lost labour spent;<br>       And when the weary king gave place to night,<br>     His beams he to his royal brother lent,<br>       And so shone still in his reflective light.</p>
<p> 254<br>  Night came, but without darkness or repose,–<br>       A dismal picture of the general doom,<br>     Where souls, distracted when the trumpet blows,<br>       And half unready, with their bodies come.</p>
<p> 255<br>  Those who have homes, when home they do repair,<br>       To a last lodging call their wandering friends:<br>     Their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care,<br>       To look how near their own destruction tends.</p>
<p> 256<br>  Those who have none, sit round where once it was,<br>       And with full eyes each wonted room require;<br>     Haunting the yet warm ashes of the place,<br>       As murder’d men walk where they did expire.</p>
<p> 257<br>  Some stir up coals, and watch the vestal fire,<br>       Others in vain from sight of ruin run;<br>     And, while through burning labyrinths they retire,<br>       With loathing eyes repeat what they would shun.</p>
<p> 258<br>  The most in fields like herded beasts lie down,<br>       To dews obnoxious on the grassy floor;<br>     And while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown,<br>       Sad parents watch the remnants of their store.</p>
<p> 259<br>  While by the motion of the flames they guess<br>       What streets are burning now, and what are near;<br>     An infant waking to the paps would press,<br>       And meets, instead of milk, a falling tear.</p>
<p> 260<br>  No thought can ease them but their sovereign’s care,<br>       Whose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing:<br>     Even those whom want might drive to just despair,<br>       Think life a blessing under such a king.</p>
<p> 261<br>  Meantime he sadly suffers in their grief,<br>       Out-weeps an hermit, and out-prays a saint:<br>     All the long night he studies their relief,<br>       How they may be supplied, and he may want.</p>
<p> 262<br>  O God, said he, thou patron of my days,<br>       Guide of my youth in exile and distress!<br>     Who me, unfriended, brought’st by wondrous ways,<br>       The kingdom of my fathers to possess:</p>
<p> 263<br>  Be thou my judge, with what unwearied care<br>       I since have labour’d for my people’s good;<br>     To bind the bruises of a civil war,<br>       And stop the issues of their wasting blood.</p>
<p> 264<br>  Thou who hast taught me to forgive the ill,<br>       And recompense, as friends, the good misled;<br>     If mercy be a precept of thy will,<br>       Return that mercy on thy servant’s head.</p>
<p> 265<br>  Or if my heedless youth has stepp’d astray,<br>       Too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand;<br>     On me alone thy just displeasure lay,<br>       But take thy judgments from this mourning land.</p>
<p> 266<br>  We all have sinn’d, and thou hast laid us low,<br>       As humble earth from whence at first we came:<br>     Like flying shades before the clouds we show,<br>       And shrink like parchment in consuming flame.</p>
<p> 267<br>  O let it be enough what thou hast done;<br>       When spotted Deaths ran arm’d through every street,<br>     With poison’d darts which not the good could shun,<br>       The speedy could out-fly, or valiant meet.</p>
<p> 268<br>  The living few, and frequent funerals then,<br>       Proclaim’d thy wrath on this forsaken place;<br>     And now those few who are return’d again,<br>       Thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace.</p>
<p> 269<br>  O pass not, Lord, an absolute decree,<br>       Or bind thy sentence unconditional!<br>     But in thy sentence our remorse foresee,<br>       And in that foresight this thy doom recall.</p>
<p> 270<br>  Thy threatenings, Lord, as thine thou mayst revoke:<br>       But if immutable and fix’d they stand,<br>     Continue still thyself to give the stroke,<br>       And let not foreign foes oppress thy land.</p>
<p> 271<br>  The Eternal heard, and from the heavenly quire<br>       Chose out the cherub with the flaming sword;<br>     And bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire<br>       From where our naval magazines were stored.</p>
<p> 272<br>  The blessed minister his wings display’d,<br>       And like a shooting star he cleft the night:<br>     He charged the flames, and those that disobey’d<br>       He lash’d to duty with his sword of light.</p>
<p> 273<br>  The fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey<br>       On pious structures, by our fathers rear’d;<br>     By which to heaven they did affect the way,<br>       Ere faith in churchmen without works was heard.</p>
<p> 274<br>  The wanting orphans saw, with watery eyes,<br>       Their founder’s charity in dust laid low;<br>     And sent to God their ever-answered cries,<br>       For He protects the poor, who made them so.</p>
<p> 275<br>  Nor could thy fabric, Paul’s, defend thee long,<br>       Though thou wert sacred to thy Maker’s praise:<br>     Though made immortal by a poet’s song;<br>       And poets’ songs the Theban walls could raise.</p>
<p> 276<br>  The daring flames peep’d in, and saw from far<br>       The awful beauties of the sacred quire:<br>     But since it was profaned by civil war,<br>       Heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire.</p>
<p> 277<br>  Now down the narrow streets it swiftly came,<br>       And widely opening did on both sides prey:<br>     This benefit we sadly owe the flame,<br>       If only ruin must enlarge our way.</p>
<p> 278<br>  And now four days the sun had seen our woes:<br>       Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire:<br>     It seem’d as if the stars more sickly rose,<br>       And farther from the feverish north retire.</p>
<p> 279<br>  In th’ empyrean heaven, the bless’d abode,<br>       The Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie,<br>     Not daring to behold their angry God;<br>       And a hush’d silence damps the tuneful sky.</p>
<p> 280<br>  At length the Almighty cast a pitying eye,<br>       And mercy softly touch’d his melting breast:<br>     He saw the town’s one half in rubbish lie,<br>       And eager flames drive on to storm the rest.</p>
<p> 281<br>  An hollow crystal pyramid he takes,<br>       In firmamental waters dipt above;<br>     Of it a broad extinguisher he makes,<br>       And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove.</p>
<p> 282<br>  The vanquish’d fires withdraw from every place,<br>       Or, full with feeding, sink into a sleep:<br>     Each household genius shows again his face,<br>       And from the hearths the little Lares creep.</p>
<p> 283<br>  Our King this more than natural change beholds;<br>       With sober joy his heart and eyes abound:<br>     To the All-good his lifted hands he folds,<br>       And thanks him low on his redeemed ground.</p>
<p> 284<br>  As when sharp frosts had long constrain’d the earth,<br>       A kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain;<br>     And first the tender blade peeps up to birth,<br>       And straight the green fields laugh with promised grain:</p>
<p> 285<br>  By such degrees the spreading gladness grew<br>       In every heart which fear had froze before:<br>     The standing streets with so much joy they view,<br>       That with less grief the perish’d they deplore.</p>
<p> 286<br>  The father of the people open’d wide<br>       His stores, and all the poor with plenty fed:<br>     Thus God’s anointed God’s own place supplied,<br>       And fill’d the empty with his daily bread.</p>
<p> 287<br>  This royal bounty brought its own reward,<br>       And in their minds so deep did print the sense,<br>     That if their ruins sadly they regard,<br>       ‘Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence.</p>
<p> 288<br>  But so may he live long, that town to sway,<br>       Which by his auspice they will nobler make,<br>     As he will hatch their ashes by his stay,<br>       And not their humble ruins now forsake.</p>
<p> 289<br>  They have not lost their loyalty by fire;<br>       Nor is their courage or their wealth so low,<br>     That from his wars they poorly would retire,<br>       Or beg the pity of a vanquish’d foe.</p>
<p> 290<br>  Not with more constancy the Jews of old,<br>       By Cyrus from rewarded exile sent,<br>     Their royal city did in dust behold,<br>       Or with more vigour to rebuild it went.</p>
<p> 291<br>  The utmost malice of their stars is past,<br>       And two dire comets, which have scourged the town,<br>     In their own plague and fire have breathed the last,<br>       Or dimly in their sinking sockets frown.</p>
<p> 292<br>  Now frequent trines the happier lights among,<br>       And high-raised Jove, from his dark prison freed,<br>     Those weights took off that on his planet hung,<br>       Will gloriously the new-laid work succeed.</p>
<p> 293<br>  Methinks already from this chemic flame,<br>       I see a city of more precious mould:<br>     Rich as the town which gives the Indies name,<br>       With silver paved, and all divine with gold.</p>
<p> 294<br>  Already labouring with a mighty fate,<br>       She shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow,<br>     And seems to have renew’d her charter’s date,<br>       Which Heaven will to the death of time allow.</p>
<p> 295<br>  More great than human now, and more august,<br>       Now deified she from her fires does rise:<br>     Her widening streets on new foundations trust,<br>       And opening into larger parts she flies.</p>
<p> 296<br>  Before, she like some shepherdess did show,<br>       Who sat to bathe her by a river’s side;<br>     Not answering to her fame, but rude and low,<br>       Nor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride.</p>
<p> 297<br>  Now, like a maiden queen, she will behold,<br>       From her high turrets, hourly suitors come;<br>     The East with incense, and the West with gold,<br>       Will stand, like suppliants, to receive her doom!</p>
<p> 298<br>  The silver Thames, her own domestic flood,<br>       Shall bear her vessels like a sweeping train;<br>     And often wind, as of his mistress proud,<br>       With longing eyes to meet her face again.</p>
<p> 299<br>  The wealthy Tagus, and the wealthier Rhine,<br>       The glory of their towns no more shall boast;<br>     And Seine, that would with Belgian rivers join,<br>       Shall find her lustre stain’d, and traffic lost.</p>
<p> 300<br>  The venturous merchant who design’d more far,<br>       And touches on our hospitable shore,<br>     Charm’d with the splendour of this northern star,<br>       Shall here unlade him, and depart no more.</p>
<p> 301<br>  Our powerful navy shall no longer meet,<br>       The wealth of France or Holland to invade;<br>     The beauty of this town without a fleet,<br>       From all the world shall vindicate her trade.</p>
<p> 302<br>  And while this famed emporium we prepare,<br>       The British ocean shall such triumphs boast,<br>     That those, who now disdain our trade to share,<br>      Shall rob like pirates on our wealthy coast.</p>
<p> 303<br>  Already we have conquer’d half the war,<br>       And the less dangerous part is left behind:<br>     Our trouble now is but to make them dare,<br>       And not so great to vanquish as to find.</p>
<p> 304<br>  Thus to the Eastern wealth through storms we go,<br>       But now, the Cape once doubled, fear no more;<br>     A constant trade-wind will securely blow,<br>       And gently lay us on the spicy shore.</p>
