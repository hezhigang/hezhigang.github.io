<h1 id="Canto-1"><a href="#Canto-1" class="headerlink" title="Canto 1"></a>Canto 1</h1><p>Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos;<br>Sedjuvat, hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis.<br>(Martial, Epigrams 12.84)</p>
<p>What dire offence from am’rous causes springs,<br>What mighty contests rise from trivial things,<br>I sing—This verse to Caryl, Muse! is due:<br>This, ev’n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:<br>Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,<br>If she inspire, and he approve my lays.</p>
<p>Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel<br>A well-bred lord t’ assault a gentle belle?<br>O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor’d,<br>Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?<br>In tasks so bold, can little men engage,<br>And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?</p>
<p>Sol thro’ white curtains shot a tim’rous ray,<br>And op’d those eyes that must eclipse the day;<br>Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,<br>And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:<br>Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock’d the ground,<br>And the press’d watch return’d a silver sound.<br>Belinda still her downy pillow press’d,<br>Her guardian sylph prolong’d the balmy rest:<br>‘Twas he had summon’d to her silent bed<br>The morning dream that hover’d o’er her head;<br>A youth more glitt’ring than a birthnight beau,<br>(That ev’n in slumber caus’d her cheek to glow)<br>Seem’d to her ear his winning lips to lay,<br>And thus in whispers said, or seem’d to say.</p>
<p>“Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish’d care<br>Of thousand bright inhabitants of air!<br>If e’er one vision touch’d thy infant thought,<br>Of all the nurse and all the priest have taught,<br>Of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen,<br>The silver token, and the circled green,<br>Or virgins visited by angel pow’rs,<br>With golden crowns and wreaths of heav’nly flow’rs,<br>Hear and believe! thy own importance know,<br>Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.<br>Some secret truths from learned pride conceal’d,<br>To maids alone and children are reveal’d:<br>What tho’ no credit doubting wits may give?<br>The fair and innocent shall still believe.<br>Know then, unnumber’d spirits round thee fly,<br>The light militia of the lower sky;<br>These, though unseen, are ever on the wing,<br>Hang o’er the box, and hover round the Ring.<br>Think what an equipage thou hast in air,<br>And view with scorn two pages and a chair.<br>As now your own, our beings were of old,<br>And once inclos’d in woman’s beauteous mould;<br>Thence, by a soft transition, we repair<br>From earthly vehicles to these of air.<br>Think not, when woman’s transient breath is fled,<br>That all her vanities at once are dead;<br>Succeeding vanities she still regards,<br>And tho’ she plays no more, o’erlooks the cards.<br>Her joy in gilded chariots, when alive,<br>And love of ombre, after death survive.<br>For when the fair in all their pride expire,<br>To their first elements their souls retire:<br>The sprites of fiery termagants in flame<br>Mount up, and take a Salamander’s name.<br>Soft yielding minds to water glide away,<br>And sip with Nymphs, their elemental tea.<br>The graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome,<br>In search of mischief still on earth to roam.<br>The light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,<br>And sport and flutter in the fields of air.</p>
<p>Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste<br>Rejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac’d:<br>For spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease<br>Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.<br>What guards the purity of melting maids,<br>In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,<br>Safe from the treach’rous friend, the daring spark,<br>The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,<br>When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,<br>When music softens, and when dancing fires?<br>‘Tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know,<br>Though honour is the word with men below.</p>
<p>Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,<br>For life predestin’d to the gnomes’ embrace.<br>These swell their prospects and exalt their pride,<br>When offers are disdain’d, and love denied:<br>Then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain,<br>While peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train,<br>And garters, stars, and coronets appear,<br>And in soft sounds ‘Your Grace’ salutes their ear.<br>‘Tis these that early taint the female soul,<br>Instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll,<br>Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,<br>And little hearts to flutter at a beau.</p>
<p>Oft, when the world imagine women stray,<br>The Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way,<br>Thro’ all the giddy circle they pursue,<br>And old impertinence expel by new.<br>What tender maid but must a victim fall<br>To one man’s treat, but for another’s ball?<br>When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,<br>If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?<br>With varying vanities, from ev’ry part,<br>They shift the moving toyshop of their heart;<br>Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,<br>Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.<br>This erring mortals levity may call,<br>Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.</p>
<p>Of these am I, who thy protection claim,<br>A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.<br>Late, as I rang’d the crystal wilds of air,<br>In the clear mirror of thy ruling star<br>I saw, alas! some dread event impend,<br>Ere to the main this morning sun descend,<br>But Heav’n reveals not what, or how, or where:<br>Warn’d by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!<br>This to disclose is all thy guardian can.<br>Beware of all, but most beware of man!”</p>
<p>He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,<br>Leap’d up, and wak’d his mistress with his tongue.<br>‘Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,<br>Thy eyes first open’d on a billet-doux;<br>Wounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read,<br>But all the vision vanish’d from thy head.</p>
<p>And now, unveil’d, the toilet stands display’d,<br>Each silver vase in mystic order laid.<br>First, rob’d in white, the nymph intent adores<br>With head uncover’d, the cosmetic pow’rs.<br>A heav’nly image in the glass appears,<br>To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;<br>Th’ inferior priestess, at her altar’s side,<br>Trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride.<br>Unnumber’d treasures ope at once, and here<br>The various off’rings of the world appear;<br>From each she nicely culls with curious toil,<br>And decks the goddess with the glitt’ring spoil.<br>This casket India’s glowing gems unlocks,<br>And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.<br>The tortoise here and elephant unite,<br>Transform’d to combs, the speckled and the white.<br>Here files of pins extend their shining rows,<br>Puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux.<br>Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;<br>The fair each moment rises in her charms,<br>Repairs her smiles, awakens ev’ry grace,<br>And calls forth all the wonders of her face;<br>Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,<br>And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.<br>The busy Sylphs surround their darling care;<br>These set the head, and those divide the hair,<br>Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown;<br>And Betty’s prais’d for labours not her own.</p>
<h1 id="Canto-2"><a href="#Canto-2" class="headerlink" title="Canto 2"></a>Canto 2</h1><p>Not with more glories, in th’ etherial plain,<br>The sun first rises o’er the purpled main,<br>Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams<br>Launch’d on the bosom of the silver Thames.<br>Fair nymphs, and well-dress’d youths around her shone,<br>But ev’ry eye was fix’d on her alone.<br>On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,<br>Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.<br>Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,<br>Quick as her eyes, and as unfix’d as those:<br>Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;<br>Oft she rejects, but never once offends.<br>Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,<br>And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.<br>Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,<br>Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:<br>If to her share some female errors fall,<br>Look on her face, and you’ll forget ‘em all.</p>
<p>This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,<br>Nourish’d two locks, which graceful hung behind<br>In equal curls, and well conspir’d to deck<br>With shining ringlets the smooth iv’ry neck.<br>Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,<br>And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.<br>With hairy springes we the birds betray,<br>Slight lines of hair surprise the finney prey,<br>Fair tresses man’s imperial race ensnare,<br>And beauty draws us with a single hair.</p>
<p>Th’ advent’rous baron the bright locks admir’d;<br>He saw, he wish’d, and to the prize aspir’d.<br>Resolv’d to win, he meditates the way,<br>By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;<br>For when success a lover’s toil attends,<br>Few ask, if fraud or force attain’d his ends.</p>
<p>For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implor’d<br>Propitious Heav’n, and ev’ry pow’r ador’d,<br>But chiefly love—to love an altar built,<br>Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.<br>There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;<br>And all the trophies of his former loves;<br>With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,<br>And breathes three am’rous sighs to raise the fire.<br>Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes<br>Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:<br>The pow’rs gave ear, and granted half his pray’r,<br>The rest, the winds dispers’d in empty air.</p>
<p>But now secure the painted vessel glides,<br>The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides,<br>While melting music steals upon the sky,<br>And soften’d sounds along the waters die.<br>Smooth flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play,<br>Belinda smil’d, and all the world was gay.<br>All but the Sylph—with careful thoughts opprest,<br>Th’ impending woe sat heavy on his breast.<br>He summons strait his denizens of air;<br>The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:<br>Soft o’er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe,<br>That seem’d but zephyrs to the train beneath.<br>Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,<br>Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold.<br>Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,<br>Their fluid bodies half dissolv’d in light,<br>Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,<br>Thin glitt’ring textures of the filmy dew;<br>Dipp’d in the richest tincture of the skies,<br>Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,<br>While ev’ry beam new transient colours flings,<br>Colours that change whene’er they wave their wings.<br>Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,<br>Superior by the head, was Ariel plac’d;<br>His purple pinions op’ning to the sun,<br>He rais’d his azure wand, and thus begun.</p>
<p>“Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear!<br>Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Dæmons, hear!<br>Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign’d<br>By laws eternal to th’ aerial kind.<br>Some in the fields of purest æther play,<br>And bask and whiten in the blaze of day.<br>Some guide the course of wand’ring orbs on high,<br>Or roll the planets through the boundless sky.<br>Some less refin’d, beneath the moon’s pale light<br>Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,<br>Or suck the mists in grosser air below,<br>Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,<br>Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,<br>Or o’er the glebe distil the kindly rain.<br>Others on earth o’er human race preside,<br>Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:<br>Of these the chief the care of nations own,<br>And guard with arms divine the British throne.</p>
<p>“Our humbler province is to tend the fair,<br>Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care.<br>To save the powder from too rude a gale,<br>Nor let th’ imprison’d essences exhale,<br>To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow’rs,<br>To steal from rainbows e’er they drop in show’rs<br>A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,<br>Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;<br>Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,<br>To change a flounce, or add a furbelow.</p>
<p>“This day, black omens threat the brightest fair<br>That e’er deserv’d a watchful spirit’s care;<br>Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight,<br>But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night.<br>Whether the nymph shall break Diana’s law,<br>Or some frail china jar receive a flaw;<br>Or stain her honour, or her new brocade,<br>Forget her pray’rs, or miss a masquerade;<br>Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;<br>Or whether Heav’n has doom’d that Shock must fall.<br>Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:<br>The flutt’ring fan be Zephyretta’s care;<br>The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;<br>And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;<br>Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav’rite lock;<br>Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.</p>
<p>“To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,<br>We trust th’ important charge, the petticoat:<br>Oft have we known that sev’n-fold fence to fail,<br>Though stiff with hoops, and arm’d with ribs of whale.<br>Form a strong line about the silver bound,<br>And guard the wide circumference around.</p>
<p>“Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,<br>His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,<br>Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o’ertake his sins,<br>Be stopp’d in vials, or transfix’d with pins;<br>Or plung’d in lakes of bitter washes lie,<br>Or wedg’d whole ages in a bodkin’s eye:<br>Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,<br>While clogg’d he beats his silken wings in vain;<br>Or alum styptics with contracting pow’r<br>Shrink his thin essence like a rivell’d flow’r.<br>Or, as Ixion fix’d, the wretch shall feel<br>The giddy motion of the whirling mill,<br>In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,<br>And tremble at the sea that froths below!”</p>
<p>He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;<br>Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend,<br>Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair,<br>Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;<br>With beating hearts the dire event they wait,<br>Anxious, and trembling for the birth of fate.</p>
<h1 id="Canto-3"><a href="#Canto-3" class="headerlink" title="Canto 3"></a>Canto 3</h1><p>Close by those meads, for ever crown’d with flow’rs,<br>Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow’rs,<br>There stands a structure of majestic frame,<br>Which from the neighb’ring Hampton takes its name.<br>Here Britain’s statesmen oft the fall foredoom<br>Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home;<br>Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,<br>Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes tea.</p>
<p>Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,<br>To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;<br>In various talk th’ instructive hours they pass’d,<br>Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;<br>One speaks the glory of the British queen,<br>And one describes a charming Indian screen;<br>A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;<br>At ev’ry word a reputation dies.<br>Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,<br>With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,<br>The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;<br>The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,<br>And wretches hang that jury-men may dine;<br>The merchant from th’ Exchange returns in peace,<br>And the long labours of the toilet cease.<br>Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,<br>Burns to encounter two adventrous knights,<br>At ombre singly to decide their doom;<br>And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.<br>Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,<br>Each band the number of the sacred nine.<br>Soon as she spreads her hand, th’ aerial guard<br>Descend, and sit on each important card:<br>First Ariel perch’d upon a Matadore,<br>Then each, according to the rank they bore;<br>For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,<br>Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.</p>
<p>Behold, four Kings in majesty rever’d,<br>With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;<br>And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow’r,<br>Th’ expressive emblem of their softer pow’r;<br>Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,<br>Caps on their heads, and halberds in their hand;<br>And parti-colour’d troops, a shining train,<br>Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.</p>
<p>The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:<br>“Let Spades be trumps!” she said, and trumps they were.</p>
<p>Now move to war her sable Matadores,<br>In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.<br>Spadillio first, unconquerable lord!<br>Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.<br>As many more Manillio forc’d to yield,<br>And march’d a victor from the verdant field.<br>Him Basto follow’d, but his fate more hard<br>Gain’d but one trump and one plebeian card.<br>With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,<br>The hoary Majesty of Spades appears;<br>Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal’d;<br>The rest, his many-colour’d robe conceal’d.<br>The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,<br>Proves the just victim of his royal rage.<br>Ev’n mighty Pam, that kings and queens o’erthrew<br>And mow’d down armies in the fights of loo,<br>Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,<br>Falls undistinguish’d by the victor Spade!</p>
<p>Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;<br>Now to the baron fate inclines the field.<br>His warlike Amazon her host invades,<br>Th’ imperial consort of the crown of Spades.<br>The Club’s black tyrant first her victim died,<br>Spite of his haughty mien, and barb’rous pride:<br>What boots the regal circle on his head,<br>His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;<br>That long behind he trails his pompous robe,<br>And of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?</p>
<p>The baron now his diamonds pours apace;<br>Th’ embroider’d King who shows but half his face,<br>And his refulgent Queen, with pow’rs combin’d<br>Of broken troops an easy conquest find.<br>Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,<br>With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.<br>Thus when dispers’d a routed army runs,<br>Of Asia’s troops, and Afric’s sable sons,<br>With like confusion diff’rent nations fly,<br>Of various habit, and of various dye,<br>The pierc’d battalions disunited fall.<br>In heaps on heaps; one fate o’erwhelms them all.</p>
<p>The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,<br>And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.<br>At this, the blood the virgin’s cheek forsook,<br>A livid paleness spreads o’er all her look;<br>She sees, and trembles at th’ approaching ill,<br>Just in the jaws of ruin, and codille.<br>And now (as oft in some distemper’d state)<br>On one nice trick depends the gen’ral fate.<br>An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen<br>Lurk’d in her hand, and mourn’d his captive Queen:<br>He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,<br>And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.<br>The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;<br>The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.</p>
<p>Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,<br>Too soon dejected, and too soon elate!<br>Sudden, these honours shall be snatch’d away,<br>And curs’d for ever this victorious day.</p>
<p>For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown’d,<br>The berries crackle, and the mill turns round.<br>On shining altars of Japan they raise<br>The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze.<br>From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,<br>While China’s earth receives the smoking tide.<br>At once they gratify their scent and taste,<br>And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.<br>Straight hover round the fair her airy band;<br>Some, as she sipp’d, the fuming liquor fann’d,<br>Some o’er her lap their careful plumes display’d,<br>Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.<br>Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,<br>And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)<br>Sent up in vapours to the baron’s brain<br>New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.<br>Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere ‘tis too late,<br>Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla’s fate!<br>Chang’d to a bird, and sent to flit in air,<br>She dearly pays for Nisus’ injur’d hair!</p>
<p>But when to mischief mortals bend their will,<br>How soon they find fit instruments of ill!<br>Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace<br>A two-edg’d weapon from her shining case;<br>So ladies in romance assist their knight<br>Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.<br>He takes the gift with rev’rence, and extends<br>The little engine on his fingers’ ends;<br>This just behind Belinda’s neck he spread,<br>As o’er the fragrant steams she bends her head.<br>Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,<br>A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair,<br>And thrice they twitch’d the diamond in her ear,<br>Thrice she look’d back, and thrice the foe drew near.<br>Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought<br>The close recesses of the virgin’s thought;<br>As on the nosegay in her breast reclin’d,<br>He watch’d th’ ideas rising in her mind,<br>Sudden he view’d, in spite of all her art,<br>An earthly lover lurking at her heart.<br>Amaz’d, confus’d, he found his pow’r expir’d,<br>Resign’d to fate, and with a sigh retir’d.</p>
<p>The peer now spreads the glitt’ring forfex wide,<br>T’ inclose the lock; now joins it, to divide.<br>Ev’n then, before the fatal engine clos’d,<br>A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos’d;<br>Fate urg’d the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,<br>(But airy substance soon unites again).<br>The meeting points the sacred hair dissever<br>From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!</p>
<p>Then flash’d the living lightning from her eyes,<br>And screams of horror rend th’ affrighted skies.<br>Not louder shrieks to pitying Heav’n are cast,<br>When husbands or when lap-dogs breathe their last,<br>Or when rich China vessels, fall’n from high,<br>In glitt’ring dust and painted fragments lie!</p>
<p>“Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,”<br>The victor cried, “the glorious prize is mine!<br>While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,<br>Or in a coach and six the British fair,<br>As long at Atalantis shall be read,<br>Or the small pillow grace a lady’s bed,<br>While visits shall be paid on solemn days,<br>When num’rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,<br>While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,<br>So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!<br>What time would spare, from steel receives its date,<br>And monuments, like men, submit to fate!<br>Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,<br>And strike to dust th’ imperial tow’rs of Troy;<br>Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,<br>And hew triumphal arches to the ground.<br>What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel<br>The conqu’ring force of unresisted steel?”</p>
<h1 id="Canto-4"><a href="#Canto-4" class="headerlink" title="Canto 4"></a>Canto 4</h1><p>But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress’d,<br>And secret passions labour’d in her breast.<br>Not youthful kings in battle seiz’d alive,<br>Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,<br>Not ardent lovers robb’d of all their bliss,<br>Not ancient ladies when refus’d a kiss,<br>Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,<br>Not Cynthia when her manteau’s pinn’d awry,<br>E’er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,<br>As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravish’d hair.</p>
<p>For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew,<br>And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,<br>Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,<br>As ever sullied the fair face of light,<br>Down to the central earth, his proper scene,<br>Repair’d to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.</p>
<p>Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,<br>And in a vapour reach’d the dismal dome.<br>No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,<br>The dreaded East is all the wind that blows.<br>Here, in a grotto, shelter’d close from air,<br>And screen’d in shades from day’s detested glare,<br>She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,<br>Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.</p>
<p>Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,<br>But diff’ring far in figure and in face.<br>Here stood Ill Nature like an ancient maid,<br>Her wrinkled form in black and white array’d;<br>With store of pray’rs, for mornings, nights, and noons,<br>Her hand is fill’d; her bosom with lampoons.</p>
<p>There Affectation, with a sickly mien,<br>Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,<br>Practis’d to lisp, and hang the head aside,<br>Faints into airs, and languishes with pride,<br>On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,<br>Wrapp’d in a gown, for sickness, and for show.<br>The fair ones feel such maladies as these,<br>When each new night-dress gives a new disease.</p>
<p>A constant vapour o’er the palace flies;<br>Strange phantoms, rising as the mists arise;<br>Dreadful, as hermit’s dreams in haunted shades,<br>Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.<br>Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,<br>Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:<br>Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,<br>And crystal domes, and angels in machines.</p>
<p>Unnumber’d throngs on ev’ry side are seen<br>Of bodies chang’d to various forms by Spleen.<br>Here living teapots stand, one arm held out,<br>One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:<br>A pipkin there, like Homer’s tripod walks;<br>Here sighs a jar, and there a goose pie talks;<br>Men prove with child, as pow’rful fancy works,<br>And maids turn’d bottles, call aloud for corks.</p>
<p>Safe pass’d the Gnome through this fantastic band,<br>A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand.<br>Then thus address’d the pow’r: “Hail, wayward Queen!<br>Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:<br>Parent of vapours and of female wit,<br>Who give th’ hysteric, or poetic fit,<br>On various tempers act by various ways,<br>Make some take physic, others scribble plays;<br>Who cause the proud their visits to delay,<br>And send the godly in a pet to pray.<br>A nymph there is, that all thy pow’r disdains,<br>And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.<br>But oh! if e’er thy gnome could spoil a grace,<br>Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,<br>Like citron waters matrons’ cheeks inflame,<br>Or change complexions at a losing game;<br>If e’er with airy horns I planted heads,<br>Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,<br>Or caus’d suspicion when no soul was rude,<br>Or discompos’d the head-dress of a prude,<br>Or e’er to costive lap-dog gave disease,<br>Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:<br>Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin;<br>That single act gives half the world the spleen.”</p>
<p>The goddess with a discontented air<br>Seems to reject him, though she grants his pray’r.<br>A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds,<br>Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;<br>There she collects the force of female lungs,<br>Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.<br>A vial next she fills with fainting fears,<br>Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.<br>The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,<br>Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.</p>
<p>Sunk in Thalestris’ arms the nymph he found,<br>Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.<br>Full o’er their heads the swelling bag he rent,<br>And all the Furies issu’d at the vent.<br>Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,<br>And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.<br>“Oh wretched maid!” she spread her hands, and cried,<br>(While Hampton’s echoes, “Wretched maid!” replied)<br>“Was it for this you took such constant care<br>The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?<br>For this your locks in paper durance bound,<br>For this with tort’ring irons wreath’d around?<br>For this with fillets strain’d your tender head,<br>And bravely bore the double loads of lead?<br>Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,<br>While the fops envy, and the ladies stare!<br>Honour forbid! at whose unrivall’d shrine<br>Ease, pleasure, virtue, all, our sex resign.<br>Methinks already I your tears survey,<br>Already hear the horrid things they say,<br>Already see you a degraded toast,<br>And all your honour in a whisper lost!<br>How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?<br>‘Twill then be infamy to seem your friend!<br>And shall this prize, th’ inestimable prize,<br>Expos’d through crystal to the gazing eyes,<br>And heighten’d by the diamond’s circling rays,<br>On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?<br>Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow,<br>And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;<br>Sooner let earth, air, sea, to chaos fall,<br>Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!”</p>
<p>She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,<br>And bids her beau demand the precious hairs:<br>(Sir Plume, of amber snuff-box justly vain,<br>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)<br>With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,<br>He first the snuffbox open’d, then the case,<br>And thus broke out—“My Lord, why, what the devil?<br>Z——ds! damn the lock! ‘fore Gad, you must be civil!<br>Plague on’t! ‘tis past a jest—nay prithee, pox!<br>Give her the hair”—he spoke, and rapp’d his box.</p>
<p>“It grieves me much,” replied the peer again<br>“Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.<br>But by this lock, this sacred lock I swear,<br>(Which never more shall join its parted hair;<br>Which never more its honours shall renew,<br>Clipp’d from the lovely head where late it grew)<br>That while my nostrils draw the vital air,<br>This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.”<br>He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread<br>The long-contended honours of her head.</p>
<p>But Umbriel, hateful gnome! forbears not so;<br>He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow.<br>Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,<br>Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown’d in tears;<br>On her heav’d bosom hung her drooping head,<br>Which, with a sigh, she rais’d; and thus she said:</p>
<p>“For ever curs’d be this detested day,<br>Which snatch’d my best, my fav’rite curl away!<br>Happy! ah ten times happy, had I been,<br>If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!<br>Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,<br>By love of courts to num’rous ills betray’d.<br>Oh had I rather unadmir’d remain’d<br>In some lone isle, or distant northern land;<br>Where the gilt chariot never marks the way,<br>Where none learn ombre, none e’er taste bohea!<br>There kept my charms conceal’d from mortal eye,<br>Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die.<br>What mov’d my mind with youthful lords to roam?<br>Oh had I stay’d, and said my pray’rs at home!<br>‘Twas this, the morning omens seem’d to tell,<br>Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;<br>The tott’ring china shook without a wind,<br>Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!<br>A Sylph too warn’d me of the threats of fate,<br>In mystic visions, now believ’d too late!<br>See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!<br>My hands shall rend what ev’n thy rapine spares:<br>These, in two sable ringlets taught to break,<br>Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck.<br>The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,<br>And in its fellow’s fate foresees its own;<br>Uncurl’d it hangs, the fatal shears demands,<br>And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.<br>Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize<br>Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!”</p>
<h1 id="Canto-5"><a href="#Canto-5" class="headerlink" title="Canto 5"></a>Canto 5</h1><p>She said: the pitying audience melt in tears,<br>But Fate and Jove had stopp’d the Baron’s ears.<br>In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,<br>For who can move when fair Belinda fails?<br>Not half so fix’d the Trojan could remain,<br>While Anna begg’d and Dido rag’d in vain.<br>Then grave Clarissa graceful wav’d her fan;<br>Silence ensu’d, and thus the nymph began.</p>
<p>“Say, why are beauties prais’d and honour’d most,<br>The wise man’s passion, and the vain man’s toast?<br>Why deck’d with all that land and sea afford,<br>Why angels call’d, and angel-like ador’d?<br>Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov’d beaux,<br>Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows?<br>How vain are all these glories, all our pains,<br>Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:<br>That men may say, when we the front-box grace:<br>‘Behold the first in virtue, as in face!’<br>Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,<br>Charm’d the smallpox, or chas’d old age away;<br>Who would not scorn what housewife’s cares produce,<br>Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?<br>To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint,<br>Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint.<br>But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,<br>Curl’d or uncurl’d, since locks will turn to grey,<br>Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,<br>And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;<br>What then remains but well our pow’r to use,<br>And keep good humour still whate’er we lose?<br>And trust me, dear! good humour can prevail,<br>When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.<br>Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;<br><strong>Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.</strong>“</p>
<p>So spoke the dame, but no applause ensu’d;<br>Belinda frown’d, Thalestris call’d her prude.<br>“To arms, to arms!” the fierce virago cries,<br>And swift as lightning to the combat flies.<br>All side in parties, and begin th’ attack;<br>Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;<br>Heroes’ and heroines’ shouts confus’dly rise,<br>And bass, and treble voices strike the skies.<br>No common weapons in their hands are found,<br>Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.</p>
<p>So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,<br>And heav’nly breasts with human passions rage;<br>‘Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms;<br>And all Olympus rings with loud alarms.<br>Jove’s thunder roars, heav’n trembles all around;<br>Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound;<br>Earth shakes her nodding tow’rs, the ground gives way;<br>And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!</p>
<p>Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce’s height<br>Clapp’d his glad wings, and sate to view the fight:<br>Propp’d on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey<br>The growing combat, or assist the fray.</p>
<p>While through the press enrag’d Thalestris flies,<br>And scatters death around from both her eyes,<br>A beau and witling perish’d in the throng,<br>One died in metaphor, and one in song.<br>“O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,”<br>Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.<br>A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,<br>“Those eyes are made so killing”—was his last.<br>Thus on Mæeander’s flow’ry margin lies<br>Th’ expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.</p>
<p>When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,<br>Chloe stepp’d in, and kill’d him with a frown;<br>She smil’d to see the doughty hero slain,<br>But at her smile, the beau reviv’d again.</p>
<p>Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,<br>Weighs the men’s wits against the lady’s hair;<br>The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;<br>At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.</p>
<p>See, fierce Belinda on the baron flies,<br>With more than usual lightning in her eyes,<br>Nor fear’d the chief th’ unequal fight to try,<br>Who sought no more than on his foe to die.<br>But this bold lord with manly strength endu’d,<br>She with one finger and a thumb subdu’d:<br>Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,<br>A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;<br>The Gnomes direct, to ev’ry atom just,<br>The pungent grains of titillating dust.<br>Sudden, with starting tears each eye o’erflows,<br>And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.</p>
<p>“Now meet thy fate”, incens’d Belinda cried,<br>And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.<br>(The same, his ancient personage to deck,<br>Her great great grandsire wore about his neck<br>In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,<br>Form’d a vast buckle for his widow’s gown:<br>Her infant grandame’s whistle next it grew,<br>The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;<br>Then in a bodkin grac’d her mother’s hairs,<br>Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)</p>
<p>“Boast not my fall,” he cried, “insulting foe!<br>Thou by some other shalt be laid as low.<br>Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind;<br>All that I dread is leaving you benind!<br>Rather than so, ah let me still survive,<br>And burn in Cupid’s flames—but burn alive.”</p>
<p>“Restore the lock!” she cries; and all around<br>“Restore the lock!” the vaulted roofs rebound.<br>Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain<br>Roar’d for the handkerchief that caus’d his pain.<br>But see how oft ambitious aims are cross’d,<br>The chiefs contend ‘till all the prize is lost!<br>The lock, obtain’d with guilt, and kept with pain,<br>In ev’ry place is sought, but sought in vain:<br>With such a prize no mortal must be blest,<br>So Heav’n decrees! with Heav’n who can contest?</p>
<p>Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere,<br>Since all things lost on earth are treasur’d there.<br>There hero’s wits are kept in pond’rous vases,<br>And beaux’ in snuff boxes and tweezercases.<br>There broken vows and deathbed alms are found,<br>And lovers’ hearts with ends of riband bound;<br>The courtier’s promises, and sick man’s prayers,<br>The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,<br>Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,<br>Dried butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.</p>
<p>But trust the Muse—she saw it upward rise,<br>Though mark’d by none but quick, poetic eyes:<br>(So Rome’s great founder to the heav’ns withdrew,<br>To Proculus alone confess’d in view)<br>A sudden star, it shot through liquid air,<br>And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.<br>Not Berenice’s locks first rose so bright,<br>The heav’ns bespangling with dishevell’d light.<br>The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,<br>And pleas’d pursue its progress through the skies.</p>
<p>This the beau monde shall from the Mall survey,<br>And hail with music its propitious ray.<br>This the blest lover shall for Venus take,<br>And send up vows from Rosamonda’s lake.<br>This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,<br>When next he looks through Galileo’s eyes;<br>And hence th’ egregious wizard shall foredoom<br>The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.</p>
<p>Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravish’d hair,<br>Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!<br>Not all the tresses that fair head can boast<br>Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost.<br>For, after all the murders of your eye,<br>When, after millions slain, yourself shall die:<br>When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,<br>And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,<br>This lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame<br>And ‘midst the stars inscribe Belinda’s name.</p>
