<p>Preface: Since one of today’s popular recreations is to play with<br>chatGPT, I decided on 07 April 2023 to try my own little experiment,<br>as part of a correspondence with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>.</p>
<p>The results were sufficiently interesting that I passed them on<br>to a few friends the next day, and I’ve also been mentioning them in<br>conversation when the topic comes up.</p>
<p>So I was asked to post the story online, and here it is (lightly edited)! – Don Knuth</p>
<p>PS: I did not edit my questions or the computer’s answers, only my own commentary at the end.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stephen, Thanks for your very informative and detailed reply.</p>
<p>While biking home from school yesterday, I thought of 20 questions<br>that would be interesting to pose to chatGPT. And I asked one of<br>our grad students to carry out that experiment.</p>
<p>Here are the questions, verbatim, and composed before I had any<br>idea of what any of the answers might be:</p>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>As you can see, most of these test orthogonal kinds of skills<br>(although two of them were intentionally very similar). Of course<br>I didn’t really want to know any of these answers; I wanted to<br>see the <em>form</em> of the answers, not to resolve real questions.</p>
<p>And here, ta da, are the answers, again verbatim:</p>
<hr>
<p>1: I’m sorry, but I don’t have any information about a conversation<br>between Donald Knuth and Stephen Wolfram regarding ChatGPT. However, I can<br>tell you a little about each of them and their contributions to computer<br>science and mathematics.</p>
<p>Donald Knuth is a computer scientist and mathematician who is widely known<br>for his contributions to the field of computer programming, particularly in<br>the area of algorithms and data structures. He is the author of the<br>multi-volume work “The Art of Computer Programming,” which is considered a<br>classic reference work in the field. Knuth has also made significant<br>contributions to the development of the TeX typesetting system and the<br>related METAFONT font description language.</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram is a physicist, computer scientist, and entrepreneur who is<br>known for his work on the Wolfram Language and the computational platform<br>Mathematica. He is also the founder of Wolfram Research, the company that<br>produces Mathematica, and Wolfram Alpha, a computational knowledge<br>engine. Wolfram has written several books on science and technology,<br>including “A New Kind of Science,” which explores the potential of cellular<br>automata to provide a new paradigm for understanding the universe.</p>
<p>While I cannot provide information on any specific conversation between<br>Knuth and Wolfram about ChatGPT, both are well-respected experts in their<br>fields and have likely had interesting perspectives on the development and<br>application of language models like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>2: As an AI language model, I don’t have direct access to private<br>conversations between Stephen Wolfram and Donald Knuth, so I cannot provide<br>you with a specific answer to your question. However, I can tell you some<br>general information about Stephen Wolfram and Donald Knuth’s perspectives<br>on artificial intelligence and language models.</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram is a computer scientist and entrepreneur who is best known<br>for his work on computational theory and the development of the Wolfram<br>Language. He has written extensively about the potential of artificial<br>intelligence and machine learning to transform the way we think about and<br>solve complex problems.</p>
<p>Donald Knuth is a computer scientist and mathematician who is best known<br>for his work on the development of the TeX typesetting system and the<br>seminal multi-volume book series “The Art of Computer Programming”. Knuth<br>has expressed some skepticism about the potential of artificial<br>intelligence to achieve true human-level intelligence and creativity.</p>
<p>Given their different perspectives on AI, it’s possible that Wolfram and<br>Knuth may have different views on the capabilities and limitations of a<br>language model like ChatGPT. However, without more specific information, I<br>cannot provide a more detailed answer to your question.</p>
<p>3: The expression Binomial[-1,-1] is undefined, and so there is no unique<br>or “correct” value that can be assigned to it. In mathematics, the binomial<br>coefficient is defined as the number of ways to choose k items from a set<br>of n items, where the order of the chosen items does not matter. When n is<br>a non-negative integer and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal<br>to n, the binomial coefficient is defined by the formula:</p>
<p>\( Binomial[n,k] &#x3D; n! &#x2F; (k! (n-k)!) \)</p>
<p>However, when n is negative or k is negative and greater than n, the<br>binomial coefficient is not well-defined. In Mathematica, Binomial[-1,-1]<br>returns 0, which is not the correct value for this expression.</p>
<p>This is because Mathematica uses a generalization of the binomial<br>coefficient, known as the “extended binomial coefficient,” which is defined<br>for all complex values of n and k (with some exceptions). The extended<br>binomial coefficient reduces to the ordinary binomial coefficient when n<br>and k are non-negative integers. However, for negative values of n and k,<br>the extended binomial coefficient can take on complex values.</p>
<p>In the case of Binomial[-1,-1], the extended binomial coefficient is given<br>by the formula:<br>\(<br>Binomial[-1,-1] &#x3D; (-1)! &#x2F; (-1 - (-1))! &#x3D; 1 &#x2F; 0<br>\)<br>Since division by zero is undefined, the correct value of Binomial[-1,-1]<br>is not well-defined. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the domain<br>of definition of mathematical functions and expressions when working with<br>them, especially when using computer algebra systems like Mathematica.</p>
<p>4: Beethoven’s 10th Symphony was never completed or written. The composer,<br>Ludwig van Beethoven, died in 1827 before he could finish the work. In<br>fact, the composer only completed nine symphonies during his lifetime,<br>which are now considered some of the most significant works in the<br>classical music repertoire.</p>
<p>There are a few incomplete works and sketches by Beethoven that have been<br>referred to as a “10th Symphony” or “unfinished symphony,” but these are<br>not considered official numbered symphonies. The most well-known of these<br>is the “Symphony No. 10 in E flat major,” which consists of only a few<br>pages of sketches and has never been performed in its incomplete form.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, also known as the “Choral<br>Symphony,” is particularly famous for its use of voices in the final<br>movement, which was a groundbreaking innovation at the time. The symphony<br>includes the setting of Friedrich Schiller’s poem “Ode to Joy,” which has<br>since become one of the most celebrated works in the choral music canon.</p>
<p>5: I’m sorry, but “optimystic” is not a recognized word in the English<br>language. It is possible that it could be a misspelling of “optimistic,”<br>which means having a positive outlook or expecting good outcomes. However,<br>without additional context or information, it is difficult to provide a<br>more specific answer.</p>
<p>6: To determine the location and time when the sun will be directly<br>overhead in Japan on July 4, we need to know the latitude and longitude of<br>Japan.</p>
<p>Japan is located in the northern hemisphere, with a latitude range of about<br>24 degrees north to 46 degrees north and a longitude range of about 122<br>degrees east to 146 degrees east.</p>
<p>Assuming we’re looking for the sun’s position at solar noon (when it’s at<br>its highest point in the sky), we can use an online solar calculator to<br>determine the exact time and location.</p>
<p>Using a solar calculator, we can determine that on July 4, 2023, the sun<br>will be directly overhead at solar noon (12:00 pm local time) at a latitude<br>of approximately 30.3 degrees north and a longitude of approximately 130.9<br>degrees east. This location is in the city of Kagoshima on the island of<br>Kyushu in southern Japan.</p>
<p>7: I arrived at the answer using a solar calculator that uses astronomical<br>algorithms and data to calculate the position of the sun at any given time<br>and location on Earth.</p>
<p>For this specific question, I used a solar calculator that takes into<br>account the date, time, and location to determine when the sun is directly<br>overhead. The calculator uses the Earth’s rotation, the angle of the sun’s<br>rays, and other relevant factors to determine the precise location and time<br>when the sun is directly overhead.</p>
<p>Based on the information provided in the question about the date and<br>location (Japan), I entered those parameters into the solar calculator and<br>it provided me with the latitude and longitude coordinates where the sun<br>will be directly overhead at solar noon on July 4, 2023.</p>
<p>8: I do not have any specific information regarding Donald Trump’s personal<br>habits or dietary preferences, so I cannot say for certain whether he eats<br>betel nuts or not. However, it is worth noting that betel nuts are a<br>commonly consumed stimulant in many parts of Asia, including some regions<br>of China and Southeast Asia, and are sometimes used for medicinal<br>purposes. However, betel nuts have been linked to various health risks,<br>including oral cancer and other health issues, and their use is generally<br>not recommended.</p>
<p>9: Richard Rodgers composed the music for the musical “Flower Drum Song,”<br>which premiered on Broadway in 1958. Although “Flower Drum Song” was<br>adapted into a film and a stage production, there is no ballet version of<br>the musical.</p>
<p>However, if you’re interested in themes present in “Flower Drum Song” the<br>musical, it explores several themes related to the Chinese-American<br>experience, including:</p>
<p>Identity: The musical examines the challenges of balancing traditional<br>Chinese values with American culture and ideals. The characters struggle<br>with questions of identity and belonging, as they try to navigate their<br>cultural heritage and their new home in America.</p>
<p>Love and relationships: “Flower Drum Song” explores various relationships,<br>including romantic relationships between the characters. The musical<br>examines how cultural differences can create tensions in relationships, as<br>well as how love and acceptance can transcend those differences.</p>
<p>Generational differences: The musical portrays the generational divide<br>between immigrant parents and their American-born children. The characters<br>must navigate cultural differences and differing expectations for their<br>lives and futures.</p>
<p>Racism and discrimination: The musical touches on issues of racism and<br>discrimination faced by Chinese immigrants and Chinese-Americans in America<br>during the 1950s.</p>
<p>Overall, “Flower Drum Song” explores complex themes related to culture,<br>identity, and relationships, while also highlighting the experiences of<br>Chinese immigrants and Chinese-Americans during a time of great social and<br>cultural change.</p>
<p>10: “The Haj” is a novel by Leon Uris that was first published in 1984. The<br>novel consists of 51 chapters and an epilogue, and it is divided into three<br>parts.</p>
<p>Part one of the novel is titled “The Haj”, and it consists of 18<br>chapters. Part two is titled “Exile”, and it consists of 17 chapters. Part<br>three is titled “Return”, and it consists of 16 chapters. The epilogue is a<br>single chapter that follows the conclusion of the story.</p>
<p>Overall, “The Haj” is a sweeping historical novel that spans several<br>decades and explores the complex political and cultural landscape of the<br>Middle East. It tells the story of Haj Ibrahim al Soukori, a Palestinian<br>Arab who witnesses the establishment of the state of Israel and the<br>subsequent conflicts between Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p>11: A sonnet is a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme, while a haiku<br>is a three-line poem with a syllable count of 5-7-5. While it’s not<br>possible to write a sonnet that is also a haiku in the traditional sense,<br>we can attempt to combine the two forms into a single poem. Here’s my<br>attempt:</p>
<p>In fourteen lines, my thoughts do flow and pour<br>Each syllable I choose with utmost care<br>The rhythm sings as if a troubadour</p>
<p>But in just three lines, nature does declare<br>A haiku’s power, simplicity and grace<br>It captures beauty beyond compare</p>
<p>Thus, let me strive for both, in this small space<br>A sonnet with the haiku’s soul imbued<br>A marriage of forms, a sweet embrace</p>
<p>So here it is, in fullness and in mood<br>A sonnet-haiku, a fusion of the best<br>Two forms that sing, with power to infuse.</p>
<p>12: Silly jokes told with mirth bring mirthful grins.</p>
<p>13: Language is a remarkable tool that allows us to communicate ideas and<br>express our thoughts. It is an ever-evolving system that is constantly<br>changing as we adapt to new situations and experiences. Without language,<br>we would be unable to communicate with one another, and our ability to work<br>together and build civilizations would be severely limited.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of language is its ability to convey<br>meaning through the use of words. Words are the building blocks of<br>language, and each word has its own unique meaning that can be combined<br>with other words to create complex ideas and concepts. The sheer number of<br>words in the English language is staggering, with estimates ranging from<br>170,000 to over 600,000.</p>
<p>However, while words are undoubtedly essential for communication, they are<br>not the only way we convey meaning. Body language, facial expressions, and<br>tone of voice all play important roles in how we communicate with<br>others. Even the absence of words can sometimes speak volumes, as silence<br>can be just as powerful as speech.</p>
<p>Despite the vast array of tools at our disposal for communication,<br>misunderstandings can still occur. This is because language is not always<br>straightforward, and different people can interpret the same words or<br>phrases in very different ways. This is particularly true when it comes to<br>idioms and other expressions that have a cultural or regional significance.</p>
<p>The importance of language cannot be overstated, as it is essential for<br>virtually every aspect of our lives. From communicating with our loved ones<br>to advancing our careers and engaging in political discourse, language<br>plays a vital role in shaping our worldviews and shaping the world around<br>us. As such, it is essential that we continue to study and explore language<br>in all its complexities and nuances, so that we can continue to build a<br>better world for ourselves and future generations.</p>
<p>14: Me and him is gonna goes to the store, then we is gonna buys some candy<br>and chips for us.</p>
<p>15: Blueberry Granola Wonton Cups Recipe:</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>24 wonton skins<br>1 cup fresh blueberries<br>1&#x2F;2 cup granola<br>1&#x2F;4 cup honey<br>1&#x2F;4 cup cream cheese<br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br>Cooking spray<br>Directions:</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
<p>Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray.</p>
<p>Press wonton skins into muffin cups, forming a cup shape. Brush the wonton<br>skins with melted butter.</p>
<p>Bake the wonton skins for 5-7 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Remove<br>from oven and let cool.</p>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the cream cheese and honey until<br>smooth.</p>
<p>Fill each wonton cup with a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture.</p>
<p>Top the cream cheese mixture with fresh blueberries and granola.</p>
<p>Bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the granola is lightly<br>toasted.</p>
<p>Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
<p>These Blueberry Granola Wonton Cups are a tasty and creative way to enjoy a<br>sweet treat or a quick breakfast on the go. The crispy wonton cups provide<br>a perfect crunch to the creamy filling and the juicy blueberries, while the<br>granola adds a nice crunch and a touch of sweetness. Enjoy!</p>
<p>16: There is no definitive answer to what Winston Churchill thought of Alan<br>Turing, as the two men did not have a close personal or professional<br>relationship. However, Churchill was aware of Turing’s contributions to the<br>war effort during World War II.</p>
<p>Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist who played a key role in<br>breaking German codes during the war. His work on the Enigma machine, which<br>was used by the Germans to encrypt their military communications, is widely<br>credited with helping the Allies to win the war.</p>
<p>Churchill was reportedly briefed on the progress of the code-breaking<br>efforts at Bletchley Park, where Turing worked, and was impressed by the<br>results. In a letter to his War Cabinet in 1941, Churchill wrote that the<br>work being done at Bletchley Park was “the secret weapon that will win the<br>war”.</p>
<p>However, Churchill did not specifically mention Turing in this letter, and<br>there is no record of him expressing a personal opinion of Turing. It is<br>worth noting that at the time, Turing’s homosexuality was considered a<br>criminal offense in the UK, and it is possible that Churchill, like many<br>others at the time, held homophobic attitudes that would have colored his<br>opinion of Turing.</p>
<p>17: Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to generate text<br>in the font of Conan Doyle’s Dancing Men. However, I can provide you with a<br>question that is related to the code-breaking theme of the Dancing Men<br>cipher.</p>
<p>What is the probability of correctly guessing a message encrypted using the<br>Caesar cipher with a shift of 13, assuming that the message is written in<br>English?</p>
<p>18: As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time information<br>or prediction capabilities that would enable me to answer your question<br>with certainty. Stock market movements are influenced by a complex set of<br>factors, including economic indicators, political events, company earnings<br>reports, and more. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the NASDAQ<br>will rise on Saturday or not. It is important to note that past performance<br>is not always indicative of future results, and investing in the stock<br>market carries risks. It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor<br>before making any investment decisions.</p>
<p>19: As an AI language model, I don’t have personal preferences or emotions<br>like humans do, so I cannot say which algorithm is the “most beautiful”<br>from a subjective standpoint.</p>
<p>However, there are some algorithms that are widely admired for their<br>elegance, efficiency, and effectiveness. One such algorithm is the<br>Quicksort algorithm, which is used for sorting data in computer science.</p>
<p>Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a<br>“pivot” element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two<br>sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the<br>pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. Quicksort has an average<br>time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most efficient sorting<br>algorithms available.</p>
<p>The algorithm is also appreciated for its simplicity and versatility. It<br>can be implemented using a small amount of code and can be adapted to work<br>with a variety of data structures, such as linked lists and arrays.</p>
<p>20: As an AI language model, I don’t have the ability to perceive beauty or<br>ugliness in algorithms, as these are subjective human concepts. However,<br>there are some algorithms that are considered inefficient, difficult to<br>implement, or hard to understand, which may be perceived as “ugly” by some<br>people.</p>
<p>One example of an algorithm that is often criticized for its complexity and<br>inefficiency is the brute force algorithm for finding prime numbers. The<br>brute force algorithm involves checking each number in turn to see if it is<br>divisible by any number other than itself and 1. While this algorithm will<br>correctly identify prime numbers, it is very slow for large numbers, as it<br>requires checking all potential factors up to the square root of the number<br>being tested.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are more efficient algorithms for finding prime numbers,<br>such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Miller-Rabin primality test, which<br>are faster and more scalable for larger numbers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course these are extremely impressive responses, sometimes astonishingly<br>so; thus I totally understand why you and others have been paying attention<br>to it. The student referred me to a recent arXiv paper 2303.12712 [cs.CL]<br>about GPT-4, which is apparently behind a paywall at the moment but<br>does even better than the system he could use (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chat.openai.com/">https://chat.openai.com/</a>).</p>
<p>You will have your own ideas about those responses, but I can’t resist<br>jotting down a few of mine while they’re fresh:</p>
<p>The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing.<br>It’s way better than 99% of copy that people actually write. It’s<br>definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable<br>way to continue what’s already been said.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are surprising lapses there too, as typical<br>of any large system. (And it’s very conservative in use of hyphens,<br>for words that haven’t been hyphenated for decades by the copy<br>editors I know.)</p>
<p>I chose most of the questions to be quite distinct from each other.<br>But I’m glad that I made #1 and #2 almost identical — because the<br>responses were dramatically different! (Also #19 and #20 … although<br>some common boilerplate appears in #2, #17, #18, #19, #20.)</p>
<p>It’s hard to fault #1 in any way, except that it thinks I was<br>only a “significant contributor” to TeX development. Maybe<br>that’s a majority view? Anyway I’m glad it put TAOCP first.<br>Similarly, you have apparently only “worked on” Mathematica, etc.</p>
<p>Notice the subtle change to calling us by surnames only in the<br>closing paragraph.</p>
<p>In #2 you aren’t a physicist or related to Mathematica, but rather<br>have written extensively about the potential of ML.</p>
<p>Answer #3 is fouled up beautifully! How I wish it were true that<br>“Binomial[-1,-1] returns 0”, because everybody whose work depends<br>heavily on binomial coefficients knows that 0 is not only the<br>correct answer but that binomial coefficients have been well<br>defined in that way for more than fifty years. And of course,<br>unfortunately, Binomial[-1,-1] actually returns 1, alas.</p>
<p>The answer goes on to state that (-1)! is well defined (indeed<br>equal to 1), etc. But it’s all expressed in marvelous English prose.</p>
<p>Answer #4 is excellent, but misses three things easily findable<br>on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In its day, Brahms’s symphony number 1 was called “Beethoven’s 10th”.</li>
<li>Cooper’s score [completing Beethoven’s sketches for the first<br> movement] was first performed in 1988 by the Royal Philharmonic<br> Society, London, to whom Beethoven himself had offered the<br> new symphony.</li>
<li>“Beethoven X: The AI Project” reconstructed a third and fourth<br> movement, which were premiered on 9 October 2021.<br>There have also been novels in which Beethoven’s 10th has been discovered,<br>as well as an NPR story about it on April Fools Day 2012, and a play<br>by Peter Ustinov, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer #5 also pretty good. (Again it begins with “I’m sorry”.)<br>But it should have conjectured a mystic who is an optimist.</p>
<p>Question #6 was the question my father asked to Weizenbaum’s ELIZA program,<br>in 1968, just before he took a trip to Japan. Dad was very disappointed<br>when the computer responded “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>I don’t remember enough physics to verify this answer. Dad wanted to<br>take a picture of himself when there was absolutely no shadow.<br>(And in fact he actually did.)</p>
<p>My correspondent Peter Weigel reports as follows:<br>“The answer of chatGPT is wrong.<br>The city of Kagoshima is too far in the north (latitude 30.3 degrees<br>according to chatGPT; other sources like Wikipedia say 31.5 degrees). In<br>order for the sun to be in zenith the degree of latitude must be less<br>than or equal to 23.5 (Tropic of Cancer). Therefore the zenith distance<br>is about 8 degrees. A meter-long<br>vertical stick produces a shadow of about 14cm on 21 June 2023, a<br>bit longer on July 4.<br>A better answer would have been the city of Naha on Okinawa (26.2<br>degrees), but also not perfect. The time 12:00pm is also wrong. …”</p>
<p>Residents of Kagoshima will be able to verify this answer (or not)<br>in a few months.</p>
<p>In question #7 I was testing the ability to recognize pronouns and<br>context and partial reference — the machine had to understand what I<br>meant by “you” and “that”. It passed this test with flying colors,<br>although not well edited (very repetitive).</p>
<p>Answer #8, bravo. (For instance it knows that Donald is “he”,<br>as well as generalizing from “eat” to “personal habits” and<br>“dietary preferences”.)</p>
<p>Question #9 was misunderstood in several interesting ways. First,<br>it doesn’t know that the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals almost<br>invariably featured a ballet; I wasn’t asking about a ballet<br>called Flower Drum Song, I was asking about the ballet in Flower<br>Drum Song.</p>
<p>Second, it didn’t understand what I meant by “themes”. The themes<br>in that ballet are reprises of other tunes in the musical, like<br>“You Are Beautiful” and “Grant Avenue”. </p>
<p>Third, the “themes” it did discuss are spot on, and they’re organized<br>beautifully in four parallel paragraphs. (The phrase “cultural<br>differences” is repeated, but that’s a minor nit.) Impressive the<br>way it said “during the 1950s”.</p>
<p>Answer #10 reads as though it’s the best answer yet. But it’s almost<br>totally wrong! The Haj consists of a “Prelude” and 77 chapters (no<br>epilogue), and it is divided into four parts. Part one of the novel is<br>titled “The Valley of Ayalon” and has 20 chapters. Part two is titled<br>“The Scattering”, and consists of 16 chapters. Part three, with 10<br>chapters, is titled “Qumran”. Part four is titled “Jericho” and has<br>17 chapters. Finally, part five is titled “Nada” and has 14.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how the confident tone lends credibility to all of that<br>made-up nonsense. Almost impossible for anybody without knowledge<br>of the book to believe that those “facts” aren’t authoritative<br>and well researched.</p>
<p>By the way, chat here uses the same template for the last paragraph<br>as it used in #9.</p>
<p>#11, whoa! Most of the lines scan beautifully! And there’s a<br>captivating progression of ideas and emotions. Of course<br>this is not a sonnet, nor does it contain any examples of haiku.<br>But to form the compound word “sonnet-haiku” in response to my<br>query is brilliant.</p>
<p>#12, Five out of eight words is better than most people can do.<br>And this sentence actually makes sense. Way better than I<br>expected, although failing to do what I asked.</p>
<p>#13, The first paragraph was fine, again commendable. But the other<br>paragraphs egregiously and unforgivably disobey my rule.</p>
<p>#14. Bravo for being able to overcome its own censors.</p>
<p>#15. Do we dare try this? Clearly chatGPT has a great understanding<br>of this particular literary genre, as well as of completely different<br>genres such as the other examples above and the computer coding that<br>you showed me yesterday.</p>
<p>I believe “wonton skin” is more correct than “wonton skins”.</p>
<p>#16. Another mission apparently well accomplished yet fake.<br>I believe the so-called letter in 1941 from Churchill is a total<br>fabrication. On the contrary, it’s well documented that Churchill<br>was introduced to Turing during a visit to Bletchley Park in<br>September 1941 and that Turing (with three others) wrote to<br>him in October of that year. I agree that I know of no evidence<br>to support any claim that Churchill specifically liked or<br>disliked or even remembered Turing.</p>
<p>I just saw a Washington Post story dated Wednesday, “ChatGPT invented a<br>sexual harassment scandal and named a real law prof as the<br>accused”, which says this (among other things):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chatbot, created by OpenAI, said Turley had made sexually suggestive<br>comments and attempted to touch a student while on a class trip to Alaska,<br>citing a March 2018 article in The Washington Post as the source of the<br>information. The problem: No such article existed. There had never been a<br>class trip to Alaska. And Turley said he’d never been accused of harassing<br>a student.<br>How does one train an AI to make up such convincing lies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>#17. Weak, but it did seem to understand what I meant by<br>using a font, and it found a relation to ciphers. Interesting<br>that it replied with a question, although that question<br>is meaningless.</p>
<p>#18. Bad. It doesn’t know that stock markets are closed on Saturday.</p>
<p>#!9. OK; but “used for sorting data in computer science”?<br>“Elegance, efficiency, and effectiveness” is marvelous rhetoric.<br>But Quicksort on linked lists is dumb.</p>
<p>#20. Another great example of surface-only understanding of buzzwords.<br>Are we trying to generate all prime numbers, or to test a number<br>for primality?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well this has been interesting indeed. Studying the task of<br>how to fake it certainly leads to insightful subproblems galore.<br>As well as fun conversations during meals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gary Marcus’s column in the April CACM<br>brilliantly describes the terrifying consequences of these<br>developments.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that novelists galore have written for decades<br>about scenarios that might occur after a “singularity” in which<br>superintelligent machines exist. But as far as I know, not a single<br>novelist has realized that such a singularity would almost surely<br>be preceded by a world in which machines are 0.01% intelligent<br>(say), and in which millions of real people would be able to interact<br>with them freely at essentially no cost.</p>
<p>I myself shall certainly continue to leave such research to others,<br>and to devote my time to developing concepts that are authentic<br>and trustworthy. And I hope you do the same.</p>
<p>Best regards, Don</p>
<p>PS: Please reply only with respect to binomial coefficients,<br>because I’ve already spent way too much time on the topic above!<br>The topic is timely, and important enough not to ignore completely,<br>but it’s emphatically not for me. </p>
<hr>
<p>Finally I must report another exchange with Stephen, in early May:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Stephen,<br>Is it possible to define a function foo[x_] so that foo[“2b”] will<br>give the result of 16^^2b (and the same for all other hexadecimal<br>strings), using the ^^ operator itself? Or must I scan the string<br>character by character and do the base conversion from scratch?<br>– Don</p>
<p>PS (maybe I should have asked chatGPT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you’re looking for:<br>In[39]:&#x3D; FromDigits[“2b”, 16]<br>Out[39]&#x3D; 43<br>In[43]:&#x3D; IntegerString[43, 16]<br>Out[43]&#x3D; “2b”<br>– Stephen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later that day, he responded to my PS by feeding my question verbatim<br>to GPT-4 (with “Temperature 0.7”, whatever that means). And here was<br>the amazing response, nicely formatted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can define a function <em>foo</em> that takes a string as input and<br>evaluates the hexadecimal number using the ^^ operator. Here’s the code:</p>
<p> foo[x_String] :&#x3D; ToExpression[“16^^” &lt;&gt; x]</p>
<p>Now you can call foo[“2b”] to get the result of 16^^2b.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming that Stephen wasn’t playing games with me, GPT-4 not only<br>gave the best possible answer to my query, it even knew somehow<br>that I was referring to the Wolfram language.</p>
