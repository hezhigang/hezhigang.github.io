and offend in arts<br>(As most in manners) by a love to parts.</p><p>Some to conceit alone their taste confine,<br>And glitt’ring thoughts struck out at ev’ry line;<br>Pleas’d with a work where nothing’s just or fit;<br>One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.<br>Poets, like painters, thus, unskill’d to trace<br>The naked nature and the living grace,<br>With gold and jewels cover ev’ry part,<br>And hide with ornaments their want of art.<br>True wit is nature to advantage dress’d,<br>What oft was thought, but ne’er so well express’d,<br>Something, whose truth convinc’d at sight we find,<br>That gives us back the image of our mind.<br>As shades more sweetly recommend the light,<br>So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.<br>For works may have more wit than does ‘em good,<br>As bodies perish through excess of blood.</p><p>Others for language all their care express,<br>And value books, as women men, for dress:<br>Their praise is still—“the style is excellent”:<br>The sense, they humbly take upon content.<br>Words are like leaves;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope">Alexander Pope</a></p><p>Si quid novisti rectius istis,<br>Candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum<br>&#91;If you have come to know any precept more correct than these, share it with me, brilliant one; if not, use these with me&#93; &#40;Horace, Epistle I.6.67&#41;</p><p>PART 1<br><strong>‘Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill</strong><br><strong>Appear in writing or in judging ill;</strong><br><strong>But, of the two, less dang’rous is th’ offence</strong><br><strong>To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.</strong><br><strong>Some few in that, but numbers err in this,</strong><br><strong>Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;</strong><br><strong>A fool might once himself alone expose,</strong><br><strong>Now one in verse makes many more in prose.</strong></p><p>‘Tis with our judgments as our watches, none<br>Go just alike, yet each believes his own.<br>In poets as true genius is but rare,<br>True taste as seldom is the critic’s share;<br>Both must alike from Heav’n derive their light,<br>These born to judge, as well as those to write.<br>Let such teach others who themselves excel,<br>And censure freely who have written well.<br>Authors are partial to their wit, ‘tis true,<br>But are not critics to their judgment too?</p><p>Yet if we look more closely we shall find<br>Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind;<br>Nature affords at least a glimm’ring light;<br>The lines, tho’ touch’d but faintly, are drawn right.<br>But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac’d,<br>Is by ill colouring but the more disgrac’d,<br>So by false learning is good sense defac’d;<br>Some are bewilder’d in the maze of schools,<br>And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.<br>In search of wit these lose their common sense,<br>And then turn critics in their own defence:<br>Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,<br>Or with a rival’s, or an eunuch’s spite.<br>All fools have still an itching to deride,<br>And fain would be upon the laughing side.<br>If Mævius scribble in Apollo’s spite,<br>There are, who judge still worse than he can write.</p><p>Some have at first for wits, then poets pass’d,<br>Turn’d critics next, and prov’d plain fools at last;<br>Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,<br>As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.<br>Those half-learn’d witlings, num’rous in our isle<br>As half-form’d insects on the banks of Nile;<br>Unfinish’d things, one knows not what to call,<br>Their generation’s so equivocal:<br>To tell ‘em, would a hundred tongues require,<br>Or one vain wit’s, that might a hundred tire.</p><p>But you who seek to give and merit fame,<br>And justly bear a critic’s noble name,<br>Be sure your self and your own reach to know,<br>How far your genius, taste, and learning go;<br>Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,<br>And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.</p><p>Nature to all things fix’d the limits fit,<br>And wisely curb’d proud man’s pretending wit:<br>As on the land while here the ocean gains,<br>In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;<br>Thus in the soul while memory prevails,<br>The solid pow’r of understanding fails;<br>Where beams of warm imagination play,<br>The memory’s soft figures melt away.<br>One science only will one genius fit;<br>So vast is art, so narrow human wit:<br>Not only bounded to peculiar arts,<br>But oft in those, confin’d to single parts.<br>Like kings we lose the conquests gain’d before,<br>By vain ambition still to make them more;<br>Each might his sev’ral province well command,<br>Would all but stoop to what they understand.</p><p>First follow NATURE, and your judgment frame<br>By her just standard, which is still the same:<br>Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,<br>One clear, unchang’d, and universal light,<br>Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,<br>At once the source, and end, and test of art.<br>Art from that fund each just supply provides,<br>Works without show, and without pomp presides:<br>In some fair body thus th’ informing soul<br>With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,<br>Each motion guides, and ev’ry nerve sustains;<br>Itself unseen, but in th’ effects, remains.<br>Some, to whom Heav’n in wit has been profuse,<br>Want as much more, to turn it to its use;<br>For wit and judgment often are at strife,<br>Though meant each other’s aid, like man and wife.<br>‘Tis more to guide, than spur the Muse’s steed;<br>Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;<br>The winged courser, like a gen’rous horse,<br>Shows most true mettle when you check his course.</p><p>Those RULES of old discover’d, not devis’d,<br>Are Nature still, but Nature methodis’d;<br>Nature, like liberty, is but restrain’d<br>By the same laws which first herself ordain’d.</p><p>Hear how learn’d Greece her useful rules indites,<br>When to repress, and when indulge our flights:<br>High on Parnassus’ top her sons she show’d,<br>And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;<br>Held from afar, aloft, th’ immortal prize,<br>And urg’d the rest by equal steps to rise.<br>Just precepts thus from great examples giv’n,<br>She drew from them what they deriv’d from Heav’n.<br>The gen’rous critic fann’d the poet’s fire,<br>And taught the world with reason to admire.<br>Then criticism the Muse’s handmaid prov’d,<br>To dress her charms, and make her more belov’d;<br>But following wits from that intention stray’d;<br>Who could not win the mistress, woo’d the maid;<br>Against the poets their own arms they turn’d,<br>Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn’d.<br>So modern ‘pothecaries, taught the art<br>By doctor’s bills to play the doctor’s part,<br>Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,<br>Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.<br>Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,<br>Nor time nor moths e’er spoil’d so much as they:<br>Some drily plain, without invention’s aid,<br>Write dull receipts how poems may be made:<br>These leave the sense, their learning to display,<br>And those explain the meaning quite away.</p><p>You then whose judgment the right course would steer,<br>Know well each ANCIENT’S proper character;<br>His fable, subject, scope in ev’ry page;<br>Religion, country, genius of his age:<br>Without all these at once before your eyes,<br>Cavil you may, but never criticise.<br>Be Homer’s works your study and delight,<br>Read them by day, and meditate by night;<br>Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,<br>And trace the Muses upward to their spring;<br>Still with itself compar’d, his text peruse;<br>And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.</p><p>When first young Maro in his boundless mind<br>A work t’ outlast immortal Rome design’d,<br>Perhaps he seem’d above the critic’s law,<br>And but from Nature’s fountains scorn’d to draw:<br>But when t’ examine ev’ry part he came,<br>Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.<br>Convinc’d, amaz’d, he checks the bold design,<br>And rules as strict his labour’d work confine,<br>As if the Stagirite o’erlook’d each line.<br>Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;<br>To copy nature is to copy them.</p><p>Some beauties yet, no precepts can declare,<br>For there’s a happiness as well as care.<br>Music resembles poetry, in each<br>Are nameless graces which no methods teach,<br>And which a master-hand alone can reach.<br>If, where the rules not far enough extend,<br>(Since rules were made but to promote their end)<br>Some lucky LICENCE answers to the full<br>Th’ intent propos’d, that licence is a rule.<br>Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,<br>May boldly deviate from the common track.<br>Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,<br>And rise to faults true critics dare not mend;<br>From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,<br>And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,<br>Which, without passing through the judgment, gains<br>The heart, and all its end at once attains.<br>In prospects, thus, some objects please our eyes,<br>Which out of nature’s common order rise,<br>The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.<br>But tho’ the ancients thus their rules invade,<br>(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)<br>Moderns, beware! or if you must offend<br>Against the precept, ne’er transgress its end;<br>Let it be seldom, and compell’d by need,<br>And have, at least, their precedent to plead.<br>The critic else proceeds without remorse,<br>Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.</p><p>I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts<br>Those freer beauties, ev’n in them, seem faults.<br>Some figures monstrous and misshap’d appear,<br>Consider’d singly, or beheld too near,<br>Which, but proportion’d to their light, or place,<br>Due distance reconciles to form and grace.<br>A prudent chief not always must display<br>His pow’rs in equal ranks, and fair array,<br>But with th’ occasion and the place comply,<br>Conceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly.<br>Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,<br>Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.</p><p>Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,<br>Above the reach of sacrilegious hands,<br>Secure from flames, from envy’s fiercer rage,<br>Destructive war, and all-involving age.<br>See, from each clime the learn’d their incense bring!<br>Hear, in all tongues consenting pæans ring!<br>In praise so just let ev’ry voice be join’d,<br>And fill the gen’ral chorus of mankind!<br>Hail, bards triumphant! born in happier days;<br>Immortal heirs of universal praise!<br>Whose honours with increase of ages grow,<br>As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow!<br>Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,<br>And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!<br>Oh may some spark of your celestial fire<br>The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,<br>(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights;<br>Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)<br>To teach vain wits a science little known,<br>T’ admire superior sense, and doubt their own! </p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44896/an-essay-on-criticism-part-1">An Essay on Criticism: Part 1</a></li><li><a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannette_Wing">Jeannette Wing</a></p><blockquote><p>It represents a universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer scientists, would be eager to learn and use.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Computational thinking</strong> builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine. Computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone. Computational thinking confronts the riddle of machine intelligence: What can humans do better than computers? and<br>What can computers do better than humans? Most fundamentally it addresses the question: What is computable? Today, we know only parts of the answers to such questions.</p><p><strong>Computational thinking</strong> is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. To reading, writing, and arithmetic, we should add computational thinking to every child’s analytical ability. Just as the printing press facilitated the spread of the three Rs, what is appropriately incestuous about this vision is that computing and computers facilitate the spread of computational thinking.</p><p>Computational thinking involves <strong>solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior, by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science</strong>. Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science.</p><p>Having to solve a particular problem, we might ask: How difficult is it to solve? and What’s the best way to solve it? Computer science rests on solid theoretical underpinnings to answer such questions precisely. Stating the difficulty of a problem accounts for the underlying power of the machine—the computing device that will run the solution. We must consider the machine’s instruction set, its resource constraints, and its operating environment.</p><p>In solving a problem efficiently, we might further ask whether an approximate solution is good<br>enough, whether we can use randomization to our advantage, and whether false positives or false negatives are allowed. Computational thinking is reformulating a seemingly difficult problem into one we know how to solve, perhaps by reduction, embedding, transformation, or simulation.</p><p>Computational thinking is thinking recursively. It is parallel processing. It is interpreting code as data and data as code. It is type checking as the generalization of dimensional analysis. It is recognizing both the virtues and the dangers of aliasing, or giving someone or something more than one name. It is recognizing both the cost and power of indirect addressing and procedure call. It is judging a program not just for correctness and efficiency but for aesthetics, and a system’s design for simplicity and elegance.</p><p>Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task<br>or designing a large complex system. It is separation of concerns. It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem or modeling the relevant aspects of a problem to make it tractable. It is using invariants to describe a system’s behavior succinctly and declaratively. It is having the confidence we can safely use, modify, and influence a large complex system without understanding its every detail. It is modularizing something in anticipation of multiple users or prefetching and caching in anticipation of future use.</p><blockquote><p>Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction.</p></blockquote><p>Computational thinking is thinking in terms of prevention, protection, and recovery from worst-case<br>scenarios through redundancy, damage containment, and error correction. It is calling gridlock deadlock and contracts interfaces. It is learning to avoid race conditions when synchronizing meetings with one another.</p><p>Computational thinking is using heuristic reasoning to discover a solution. It is planning, learning, and scheduling in the presence of uncertainty. It is search, search, and more search, resulting in a list of Web pages, a strategy for winning a game, or a counterexample. Computational thinking is using massive amounts of data to speed up computation. It is making trade-offs between time and space and between processing power and storage capacity.</p><p>Consider these everyday examples: When your daughter goes to school in the morning, she puts in her backpack the things she needs for the day; that’s prefetching and caching. When your son loses his<br>mittens, you suggest he retrace his steps; that’s backtracking. At what point do you stop renting skis and buy yourself a pair?; that’s online algorithms. Which line do you stand in at the supermarket?; that’s performance modeling for multi-server systems. Why does your telephone still work during a power outage?; that’s independence of failure and redundancy in design. How do Completely Automated Public Turing Test(s) to Tell Computers and Humans Apart, or CAPTCHAs, authenticate humans?; that’s exploiting the difficulty of solving hard AI problems to foil computing agents.</p><p>Computational thinking will have become ingrained in everyone’s lives when words like algorithm and precondition are part of everyone’s vocabulary; when nondeterminism and garbage collection take on the meanings used by computer scientists; and when trees are drawn upside down.</p><p>We have witnessed the influence of computational thinking on other disciplines. For example, machine learning has transformed statistics. Statistical learning is being used for problems on a scale, in terms of both data size and dimension, unimaginable only a few years ago. Statistics departments in all kinds of organizations are hiring computer scientists. Schools of computer science are embracing existing or starting up new statistics departments.</p><p>Computer scientists’recent interest in biology is driven by their belief that biologists can benefit from computational thinking. Computer science’s contribution to biology goes beyond the ability to search through vast amounts of sequence data looking for patterns. The hope is that data structures and algorithms—our computational abstractions and methods—can represent the structure of proteins in ways that elucidate their function. Computational biology is changing the way biologists<br>think. Similarly, computational game theory is changing the way economists think; nanocomputing, the way chemists think; and quantum computing, the way physicists think.</p><p>This kind of thinking will be part of the skill set of not only other scientists but of everyone else. Ubiquitous computing is to today as computational thinking is to tomorrow. Ubiquitous computing was yesterday’s dream that became today’s reality; computational thinking is tomorrow’s reality.</p><h1 id="WHAT-IT-IS-AND-ISN’T"><a href="#WHAT-IT-IS-AND-ISN’T" class="headerlink" title="WHAT IT IS, AND ISN’T"></a>WHAT IT IS, AND ISN’T</h1><p>Computer science is the study of computation — what can be computed and how to compute it. Computational thinking thus has the following characteristics:</p><p><em>Conceptualizing, not programming.</em> Computer science is not computer programming. Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction;</p><p><em>Fundamental, not rote skill.</em> A fundamental skill is something every human being must know to function in modern society. Rote means a mechanical routine. Ironically, not until computer science solves the AI Grand Challenge of making computers think like humans will thinking be rote;</p><p><em>A way that humans, not computers, think.</em> Computational thinking is a way humans solve problems; it is not trying to get humans to think like computers. Computers are dull and boring; humans are clever and imaginative. We humans make computers exciting. Equipped with computing devices, we use our cleverness to tackle problems we would not dare take on before the age of computing and build systems with functionality limited only by our imaginations;</p><p><em>Complements and combines mathematical and engineering thinking.</em> Computer science inherently draws on mathematical thinking, given that, like all sciences, its formal foundations rest on mathematics.<br>Computer science inherently draws on engineering thinking, given that we build systems that interact with the real world. The constraints of the underlying computing device force computer scientists to think computationally, not just mathematically. Being free to build virtual worlds<br>enables us to engineer systems beyond the physical world;</p><p><em>Ideas, not artifacts.</em> It’s not just the software and hardware artifacts we produce that will be physically present everywhere and touch our lives all the time, it will be the computational concepts we use to approach and solve problems, manage our daily lives, and communicate and interact<br>with other people; and</p><p><em>For everyone, everywhere.</em> Computational thinking will be a reality when it is so integral to human<br>endeavors it disappears as an explicit philosophy.</p><p>Many people equate computer science with computer programming. Some parents see only a narrow range of job opportunities for their children who major in computer science. Many people think the fundamental research in computer science is done and that only the engineering remains. Computational thinking is a grand vision to guide computer science educators, researchers, and practitioners as we act to change society’s image of the field. We especially need to reach the pre-college audience, including teachers, parents, and students, sending them two main messages:</p><p><em>Intellectually challenging and engaging scientific problems remain to be understood and solved.</em> The problem domain and solution domain are limited only by our own curiosity and creativity; and One can major in computer science and do anything. One can major in English or mathematics and go on to a multitude of different careers. Ditto computer science. One can major in computer science and go on to a career in medicine, law, business, politics, any type of science or engineering, and even the arts.</p><p>Professors of computer science should teach a course called “Ways to Think Like a Computer Scientist” to college freshmen, making it available to non-majors, not just to computer science majors. We should expose pre-college students to computational methods and models. Rather than bemoan the decline of interest in computer science or the decline in funding for research in computer science, we should look to inspire the public’s interest in the intellectual adventure of the field. We’ll thus spread the joy, awe, and power of computer science, aiming to make computational thinking commonplace.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cullen_Bryant">William Cullen Bryant</a></p><p>To him who in the love of Nature holds<br>Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br>A various language; for his gayer hours<br>She has a voice of gladness, and a smile<br>And eloquence of beauty, and she glides<br>Into his darker musings, with a mild<br>And healing sympathy, that steals away<br>Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts<br>Of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br>Over thy spirit, and sad images<br>Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br>And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br>Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—<br>Go forth, under the open sky, and list<br>To Nature’s teachings, while from all around—<br>Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—<br>Comes a still voice—<br>Yet a few days, and thee<br>The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br>Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,<br>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br>Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br>Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,<br>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br>Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br>To mix for ever with the elements,<br>To be a brother to the insensible rock<br>And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br>Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak<br>Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.</p><p>Yet not to thine eternal resting-place<br>Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish<br>Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down<br>With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,<br>The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,<br>Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br>All in one mighty sepulchre.   The hills<br>Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales<br>Stretching in pensive quietness between;<br>The venerable woods—rivers that move<br>In majesty, and the complaining brooks<br>That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,<br>Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,—<br>Are but the solemn decorations all<br>Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,<br>The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,<br>Are shining on the sad abodes of death,<br>Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread<br>The globe are but a handful to the tribes<br>That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings<br>Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,<br>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods<br>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,<br>Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there:<br>And millions in those solitudes, since first<br>The flight of years began, have laid them down<br>In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.</p><p>So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw<br>In silence from the living, and no friend<br>Take note of thy departure? All that breathe<br>Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh<br>When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br>Plod on, and each one as before will chase<br>His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br>Their mirth and their employments, and shall come<br>And make their bed with thee. As the long train<br>Of ages glide away, the sons of men,<br>The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes<br>In the full strength of years, matron and maid,<br>The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man—<br>Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,<br>By those, who in their turn shall follow them.<br>So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br>The innumerable caravan, which moves<br>To that mysterious realm, where each shall take<br>His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br>Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,<br>Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed<br>By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,<br>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br>About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatopsis">Thanatopsis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50465/thanatopsis">Thanatopsis</a></li><li><a href="https://poets.org/poem/thanatopsis">Thanatopsis</a></li></ul>]]></content>
